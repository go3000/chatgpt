A Cultural History of Civil
Examinations in Late
Imperial China

BENJAMIN A. ELMAN

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS

BERKELEY LOS ANGELES LONDON
tr tr

In the next chapters, I turn from the external, institutional; social, and
political analysis of civil examinations in practice, which: I engaged in in
Chapters ‘3 to 5, to the internal, ‘popular, literary and classical’ forms of
knowledge that’ informed: the examination curriculum and-late- ‘imperial
literati culture. The next object of analysis will be those cultural dimen-
sions that existed outside the precincts of late imperial. civil examinations,
The cultural forms and popular images we will specify were not mere
epiphenomena, hollow rhetoric, or ‘superstitious belief that grew out of an
autocratic political regime wedded to a savvy literati elite. Had they been
empty cultural forms, the examination process would not have lasted very
long, nor would: it have voluntarily drawn into its “cultural prisons” the
best and brightest of the empire.

CHAPTER SI...

Emotional Anxiety, Dreams. of Success,
and the Examination Life ©

Because the young sand the old ‘competed ‘ ‘equally” in ‘the examination
market, youths and old men brought different personal experiences into
the examination compound. The rituals of success looked alluring to the
young, while the tortures of failure were the common denominator of
older men still seeking an elusive degree. For’ all, however, their emotional
tensions, based on years of preparation for young boys, | and even more
years of defeat for old men, were the human response to the dynasty’s
examination regime. Its venues were places of opportunity for the young
who succeeded and “cultural prisons” for the ‘old who never made it out.’
The pressure to succeed molded their individual characters. For most,
Persistence, symbolized by the career of optimus Chang Chien 3% 2F (see
Chapter 5), became a way of life. Others sublimated their frustrations into
cultural symbols of elite and popular expression and, occasionally, political
Tesistance to the cultural prisons that tormented them.

The institutional mechanisms of the civil examinations mediated
between elite intellectual discourse and the everyday lives of literati.
Emotional tensions, which brought a few fame and fortune but left most
dealing with ‘despair. or disappointment, were the catalysts in their lives.”

examination, wrote about his examination experiences: “In 1891 at the
age of twenty, my [brilliant] cousin passed the provincial examination and

Popular novels such as Wu Ching-tzu’s (1701-54) The Scholars and sto-
ries by P’u Sung-ling 3#) 448% (1640-1715) were usually written in the ver-
nacular by those who failed classical examinations and therefore mocked
the selection process in a popular idiom. Such fictional accounts were not
“transparent texts.” Their narratives must be read as cultural construc-
tions that frame the examination process from the point of view of the
failures. Because such works appealed to both elites and non-elites as
a “popular” audience, I intentionally problematize the “popular-elite”
dichotomy below and show the complex and fluid interaction between
both poles.* Recorded dreams and ‘auspicious events were manifest,
nonofficial accounts of the underlying, collective mental tensions of the
examination candidates that publicly explained their individual success or
failure.> ne -
_ Hence, the anxiety produced by examinations was a historical phenom-
enon, which was ‘experienced most personally and deeply by boys and
men, given the gender ideology of their patriarchal society. Fathers and
mothers, sisters and extended relatives, were not immune to this anxiety:
They shared in the experience and offered comfort, solace, and encour

agement, but the direct, personal experience of: examination, success: or
failure belonged to the millions of male examination candidates who, as
we have seen, competed* with each other. against increasingly difficult
odds. A deep chasm of social and political making separated the official
classical standards of the examiners (see. Chapter 8).from the religious
strategies candidates were willing to appropriate therapeutically to assuage
their fears and emotions. . Se
The frustration of literati in. civil. examinations was a common. theme
since Sui and ‘T’ang times.® The required levels of memorizing characters,
wide reading in classical works, and years of training needed to write clas-
sical essays (and regulated verse after 1756) entailed a childhood and
young adulthood that sons of elites shared over time across generations
and empirewide across linguistic and geographic barriers. ‘Those who
short-circuited the educational regime by mastering model examination
essays and leaving the task of memorization: to others were nonetheless
classically literate if they hoped to get beyond the local licensing and qual-
ifying examinations and enter officialdom.. ce
Classical illiteracy was common in local tests, as we saw in the account
of fung-sheng and sheng-yuan in Chapter 4, but the classically illiterate were
generally weeded out in provincial examinations, where corruption inside
the examination compound: and examiner bribery were more telling alter-
nate routes for classical literates to gain chii-jen and chin-shih degrees. In a
tnennial provincial examination market with 50 to 75 thousand candidates
i Ming times, and-100 to 150 thousand in the Qing, the challenge was
not to demonstrate classical literacy, which was the cultural divider. for
boys in local examinations, but to write elegant ecight-legged essays that
he’ stand out ina sea of essays by youths and old men who had honed
lie wnitng skills for decades. An attempt by a classically illiterate candi-
to buy a lower degree was exposed quickly enough when such a
coun man bribed his way into office and was found out. The Ch’ing
1 particular was always on the watch for such consequences.’

phenomenon generated by the historical experiences of men in individual

diagnosed a’ particular form of “emotional stasis” (yi #8), whose dis-
cernible symptoms of anxiety (ssu-ydi §8 #8) they associated with failed
examination candidates continually frustrated in their quest for success.
There was no single response to this emotional pressure any more than
there was an autonomous gentry-merchant elite to dictate that response.

engendered.° ;

RELIGION AND THE POPULAR VALORIZATION
_ __ OF EXAMINATIONS

In the popular imagination, “fate” (ming 4) typically: was used .to: explain
away the inherent social and cultural inequalities at the heart of the selec-
tion process. Many: accepted their success or failure because they believed
that. the gods had ‘determined the final ranks beforehand.!°. Members of
the elite, when. unsuccessful in the examination competition themselves,
could therapeutically invoke fate to explain why others succeeded when in
fact they were not superior in any way.'' Faced with the uncertainties of
daily life, many Chinese, whether elite or peasant, had turned to’ gods,
temples, and local religious practices to negotiate the terms of their nor-
mality. One of the ironies of literati life was that an educational regime
that tested the generally areligious classical canon of the Four Books and
Five Classics, and had forbidden’ Taoist and Buddhist monks from enter-
ing the examination’hall and their patrologies from inclusion in the official
curriculum, was imbued with so many outside religious sensibilities that
there were no clear markers. between religious. and examination life. (see
also Chapter 8). In the T’ang dynasty, for instance, an imperial decree
commanded that official examination candidates should be lodged at the
Kuang-chai Temple. 3658 if they were unable to return home after an
examination that lasted into the evening. During the Sung dynasty, literati
temples honoring Confucius may have been venues of prayer before
€xaminations.!2

Tale, :

Because of my unstinting devotion to the classics through many incarnations
as a scholar, the Thearch commanded me to take charge of the Cinnamon
Record in the Heavenly Bureau. All local and national examinations, rank-
ings, colors of clothing, salaries, and enfeoffments were memorialized to me _.
and even promotions and demotions within the civil and military bureau-
cracies were under my supervision.'* —

Wen-ch’ang’s efficacy was concretely demonstrated in a story included in
the 1194 continuation of the Hua-shu about Li Teng 4 %, a talented can-
didate who had consulted with a Taoist priest to find out why after four
decades he had still not gotten the chin-shih degree. The priest checked
with Wen-ch’ang and learned:

When Li Teng was first born he was bestowed a jade seal and was fated to
place first'on the ‘district: examinations at eighteen and be optimus at the
palace examinations at age nineteen. At ‘thirty-three he should have reached
the rank of chancellor of the right. After being selected he spied on a neigh-
bor woman, Chang Yen-niang. Although the affair had not been resolved,
he had her father, Chang Ch’eng, bound and thrown into jail. For this
crime his success was postponed ten years, and he. was demoted to the sec-
ond group of successful examinees. After, being selected at the age of twen-
ty-eight, he encroached upon and seized the. dwelling of his elder brother,
Li Feng, and this resulted in litigation. For this his success was postponed
another ten years, and he was demoted to the third group of graduates.
After being selected at the age of thirty-eight, he violated in his room in
Ch’ang-an Madame née Cheng, the wife of a commoner, then framed her
hsband, Pai Yuan, for a crime. For this his success was postponed a fur-
bein ten years, and his standing was demoted to the fourth group. After

Ming scholar-official Ch’iu Chiin was still preparing for the metropolitan

provincial examination. In a dream Ch’iu spoke with Wen-ch’ang, who
praised Ch’iu for his sincerity in studies and promised that Ch’iu would
pass the upcoming examination and receive his chin-shih degree ranked
one of the top graduates. It became de rigueur for Ming candidates, such
as the Wang Yang-ming follower Yang Ch’i-yuan #56 (1547-99), who
was known. to insert Ch’an‘‘doctrine into his examination essays (see
Chapter 7), to claim that they passed only after consulting the “Divine
Lord Wen-ch’ang” (XC Af #).'6 .

An example of a religious cult for a deified historical figure frequently
invoked by Ming and Ch’ing examination candidates was that of Kuan-ti
Bil ii, the god:of war and. sometimes wealth. Kuan-ti had been apotheo-
sized in medieval times from the loyal warrior-official Kuan Ya WY,
who was romanticized in the novel Romance. of the Three Kingdoms, to Lord
Kuan 842, a deity who took pity on humans and granted merchants eco-
nomic wealth and literati examination success.'? His empirewide cult
“glorified the loyal and rewarded the good” by measuring human acts
according to the “standards of merit and evil.” Under the Ch’ing, the
Yung-cheng emperor organized the Kuan-ti cult into a hierarchy of temples
throughout the empire that the court appropriated as official guardians of
the dynasty." ,

In 1547, for example, it was noted that Kuan-ti repaid an examination
candidate, Chang Ch’un 4& ##, with provincial and metropolitan success,
after he asked Chang in the latter’s dream to treat his ear illness. Chang
was staying in a temple that had an image of Kuan-ti, and after awaker
ing, Chang discovered that the ear on the image was plugged with honey;
which he removed. The next night Chang again dreamed that Kuam®
had thanked him for his cure and that he would not forget Chang’s kind
act. In the late Ming, a chronically ill licentiate dreamed that Kuan-ti ha

Another prominent late imperial examination cult:to a historical figure
was devoted to. the early Ming. official Yi Ch’ien -F st (1398-1457).
During the Oirat. campaign and T’u-mu debacle, Yui and others in the
court had replaced the Cheng-t’ung emperor (r. 1436-49), when he was
ransomed by ‘the Oirats, with his younger brother (see Chapter 1). The
new Ching-t’ai emperor (r. 1450-56) then led the successful defense of
Peking. After returning and spending several years as a prince, the former
emperor retook the.throne in 1457 in a coup d’état, after which Yii Ch’ien
and other officials, who had sacrificed their emperor in 1449, were
accused of treason and executed. Yii Ch’ien’s name was rehabilitated in
1466, and his son petitioned in 148g to establish a, memorial shrine for his
father in his native Hang-chou near Ch’ien’s grave site. Yii Ch’ien’s
posthumous title. was later, in 1590, changed to Chung-su ‘8#A, which
became the name for his shrine. Another shrine was erected in Peking.”

Popular Lore and Religion

These religious cults were honored in Ch’ing times with visits by countless
numbers of examination candidates. Many of their experiences in seekin
the intervention of Wen-ch’ang, Kuan-ti, and Yii Ch’ien were’ publisheg
in two collections of [-wen lu. $2 fj (Records of unusual matters heard
in the examination grounds), which were based on accounts of Ming
and Ch’ing examination candidates and emphasized the otherworldly and
mysterious aspects of the examination market. As a’subgenre of the chih-
kuai i& PE: (records of anomalies) collections that had proliferated since
medieval times, the Ming and Ch’ing J-wen lu were continuations of earli-
er ‘T’ang and Sung records of unusual events in the civil examinations,
and they represented the popular perceptions of Chinese that reverberated
inside and outside the examination compounds.” But given the expansion
of the examinations to counties, departments, and prefectures on a regular
basis, and the increase in the number of candidates empirewide, the num-
bers of such accounts increased dramatically during the. Ming, so much so
that, as we shall see, examiners made such anomalies a frequent object of
questioning in the examinations themselves.”3 ms

In addition to such late imperial cults, both Buddhist and Taoist tem-
ples served as spiritual sites to help literati cope with the mental and emo-
tional demands of the civil examinations. Usually, the temples overlapped
with the empirewide Wen-ch’ang and Kuan-ti shrines. Kuan-ti, for exam-
ple, had already been appropriated as a Buddhist deity in the T’ang, and
during the late empire Kuan-ti’s forbidding statue stood guard at the gate
of most Buddhist temples.** In 1550, for instance, a Buddhist monk used
the technique of physiognomy (hsiang #4) to predict the success of Hsu
Chung-hsing #& '# 47° (1517-78) in the forthcoming 1550: metropolitan
examination. The monk told Hsu that he was destined to remain a chil"
degree-holder for the rest of his life and never hold a higher office than
county magistrate. When Hsu indicated displeasure with his fate, the

the “fixed regularities” (ting-shu 52 #0 of his physiognomy. Hsu nodded in
agreement, and although he was very poor, he collected thirty taels of
gold from his writing talents and secretly dropped the gold into Lake T’ai
for the fish. When the monk saw Hsu again, he immediately saw hidden
yjrtue in Hsu’s countenance, and declared that he would become a. chin-
shih the next year." - ,
Because Hsu Chung-hsing also became a high court official, the story
of his changing his fate was a parable about the examination market in
the silver age.> This clear moral inversion of the corrupt uses of gold and
silver to buy examination success by paying off examiners could also take
the form of “spirit-money” used in temples and shrines to honor the dead
and to redeem’ one’s moral debts. In Hsu’s documented case of karmic
“good deeds,” the. gold, like . spirit-money, translated into a spiritual
“payment” that yielded worldly success. Just as cultural resources invested
in a classical education were the linguistic key to a candidate’s examina-
tion success, so too the investments in. shrines and: temples and faith in
spiritual matters’ brought with them peace of mind, hope, and solace in
the face of likely examination failure.” , 4
Similarly in 1594, a Taoist scolded Chang Wei-yen $8 #2}, who, after
seeing the results posted,-attacked the civil examiners for failing him on a
1594 provincial examination. The Taoist priest had laughed at Chang and
claimed that he could tell from Chang’s physiognomy that his essays were
hot outstanding enough. When Chang angrily asked the priest how he
knew his essays were inadequate, the Taoist replied that essay writing
required spiritual peace and equanimity (/£3¢ 3-b SAA-F). Chang’s com-
motion over his failure demonstrated that his mind was not at peace, the
Priest added.

Internal; mental well-being was the spiritual correlate‘ to the external
pressures and educational requirements to succeed in late’ imperial exami-
nations. In this episode, the Taoist ideals of spiritual enlightenment were
made available in passing to a high-strung candidate who clearly had
spent years preparing for the provincial examination and could not accept
his failure when he saw the’ final list of graduates. Again, not only were
religion and morality the proper way to deal with failure without blaming
the examinations themselves, but success was ultimately tied to spiritual
enlightenment and emotional maturity. Religion and. literati’ life had
together created a remarkably healthy psychological haven from the cruel
realities of the examination compound. ee

Morality was the typical ad hoc measure of examination success. Before
the 1481 metropolitan examination, for example, Wang Yang-ming’s
father, Wang Hua = #, was staying with a wealthy family, whose master
was sonless although he had many concubines. One evening the master
sent one of the concubines to Wang’s room with a note. saying that this
was his idea so that he might have an heir. Wang refused the liaison,
writing. in reply that this would “alarm the heavens” (k’ung-ching tien-hsia
zex #6 KP). The next day a Taoist was invited into the house to pray for
the ancestors, but he fell into a deep sleep in the middle. On awakening,
the priest related that he had attended an examination in heaven, where
the chuang-yuan was announced. The Taoist, upon questioning, didn’t dare
divulge the name of the optimus, but he remembered that in the dream the
procession in front of the man was carrying a banner that read “alarm
the heavens.” :

‘Karma and retribution were also cultural constructs used in late impe™
ial times to elucidate the examination market. Yuan Huang # # (1533"
1606), one of the leaders.-of: late Ming efforts to link Taoism, Confu-
cianism, and Buddhism (san-chiao = #0, encouraged the wise of morality
books (shan-shu 2 #$) to measure an individual’s societal status and worth.
Yuan contended that “success in the examinations depends entirely
secret virtue.” He also maintained that examination success did not re

In an examination market in which most candidates for the chiijen and
chin-shih degrees in particular regarded their levels of classical literacy and
memory as roughly equivalent (they rarely blamed themselves for their
failures), most sought the explanation for why one failed while another
passed in religious terms. The impact.of Buddhism and Taoism in the
mental life of literati who mastered Ch’eng-Chu learning for the examina-
tions was widespread.2° At times, such as the late Ming, the doctrines of
Chinese religion, particularly those of Ch’an Buddhism, entered the actual
content of the examination. essays (see Chapter 7), but for the most part,
the candidates were. able to keep to the required Tao Learning curriculum
in their classical essays at the same time that their mental lives betrayed
much wider. sources of personal inspiration and moral support.

Many literati believed in reincarnation. In the 1642 provincial examina-
tions, a candidate received prior information about the questions. from an
auspicious woman who appeared in his dreams and turned, out to have
died the day the candidate was born.*! Some claimed that certain coinci-
dences in the life of the -1659 metropolitan hui-yuan Chu Chin AR SE, for
instance, indicated that he was reincarnated from a century earlier.” As a
young boy of three and four, Ch’en Yuan-lung BR ICH had dreamt of
Buddhist chants, but his mother urged him toward literati studies (ju-hsueh
ff ®) instead, claiming that the teachings of Buddhism were not worth
following. When she passed away, Ch’en refused to take any examinations
due to her death. The head of the 1679 special po-hsueh hung-tz’u examina-
ton encouraged Ch’en to, accept an invitation to participate, but to no
avail. Ch’en subsequently finished third on the 1685 palace. examination
and held high office. The tensions of Buddhism versus an official life had
taken Ch’en Yuan-lung several decades to resolve.

Despite the obvious advantages seen in the life of an official, Ming-

rom he Ses literature also offered young men a.distinct path separate

(precious scrolls) scriptures dating from the early Ming, which recorded
the efforts of moral persons who attain salvation, the combination of pop-
ular Buddhist notions of karma and literati aspirations for enlightenmen
sometimes ‘presented the examination road to fame and fortune as the
way to perdition. The contest between this-worldly success and other-
worldly enlightenment could also challenge the family values of daily life
Buddhist and Taoist clergy were’ also’ models encouraging men and
women to steer clear of social entanglements and follow a life of celibacy.*
Even when this religious ideal was compromised, a heroine such as
Hsiang-nii X (“Fragrance”) in the Liu Hsiang pao-chiian #\ ETE % (Liv
Hsiang’s precious scroll), first published in the eighteenth century, could
dismiss her husband’s examination aspirations by ‘saying, “What’s the use
of reading books?:.. It’s better to study the Way; profit lies therein. To be
an official for one life-is‘to gain enemies for ten thousand lifetimes. I am
pointing out to you the path to the Western Land. I urge you, husband,
to take the earliest opportunity to practice spiritual discipline.” Fragrance’s
mother-in-law, ‘enraged, forbade her son from ‘seeing Fragrance and
ordered- him to’ prepare for the examination. Eventually ‘he became an
optimus, but his and ‘his family’s fate was an early death ordained by the
Jade Emperor.* Fragrance, on the other hand, became a sainted religious
leader who overcame every worldly obstacle placed in her path.
“On the dark side of these uplifting tales of success or escape were the
alleged ‘criminal reasons for examination failure. A son’ dreamed of his
dead mother, who told him that his crime of three lives past had come to
light. He could not enter school and learn to read until he had expiated
his past-crimes, which eventually he did. Inside the examination com-
pound, ghosts and apparitions of the past-would appear-before candidates
to remind them of their past transgressions. In the stories, many such
young men went crazy or died on the spot.*® In fact, many candidates
accepted gossip about a custom that had supposedly developed among
examination proctors to unfurl black and red banners after the roll
inside the compound while they called out: “Wrongs will be righted; those
aggrieved will take revenge.”2” TO

Spirits and ghosts: could also play tricks with a candidate’s mind, testing
his emotional mettle. Wen-ch’ang could just as easily predict that a candi-
date’s papers in the 1640 metropolitan examination would catch fire from
the small stove in ‘his cell and would. be destroyed, and order him to pre-
pare two copies and keep.one.in reserve. The candidate obeyed, a fire did
burn up his. papers, and because of his. reserve copy he. passed.*® A spirit
could give a candidate the wrong questions for an examination in order. to
ensure that he would be unprepared and that someone else would come

out number one.”?..-;..-- te ae

Spirits could likewise affect:the examiners, as in 1726, when-Chang Lei
i % allegedly, relied: on the spirits to ferret out the. best paper -with
“hidden virtue” in the Chiang-nan provincial examination.” In.the 1783
Chiang-hsi provincial. examination,- the examiners were reported to have
chosen the top paper based on a dream of one of the examiners. In 1804
a spirit appeared in a provincial examiner’s.dream and explained the clas-
sical merits of a-particular essay to him. The spirit pointed out that the
candidate had successfully used the Erh-ya chu-shu THEE Gt (Scholia to
the progress toward correctness) etymological dictionary for one , of the
sections of his eight-legged essay (see Chapter 5).*! . a

In 1657 a candidate in the provincial examinations had completed his
essays and was waiting in his cell for them to be collected when the god
of literature (k’uei-hsing %¢ 52) danced in before his eyes and said that he
would be the chuang-yuan on this cycle of civil.examinations. The spirit
asked the candidate.to write the two characters. for chuang-yuan on its own

A profligate life usually led to failure: In 1664 a’ candidate: awaiting the
results of the metropolitan examination got drunk and passed out. In his
stupor; he recalled his past unfilial behavior toward his mother-and father
and of course on awakening discovered: he had failed.** During the 184g
Chiang-nan provincial examination, a candidate from the ‘illustrious Hsy
family of K’un-shan county, which had garnered several chin-shih degrees
early in the dynasty, went drinking after the second session, thinking that
his high ranking had-already been sealed by the essays onthe Four Books
and Five Classics he had completed. He drank himself drunk and was
unable’ to ‘meet the roll call for entering the compound to ‘complete the
third session’s required policy questions. ‘The . examiners’ initially had
ranked his eight-legged’ essays ahead. of. the’ eventual chieh-yuan, but
because his papers for the third session’ had: not been handed in, he was
disqualified.* . ' ae ms “

A reformed life, however;:would lead to success. In-a gréat turnabout,
Chang Chih-tung 5 Ziff] (1837-1909), gave up his heavy drinking as a
youth -after one of his elders in his lineage, Chang Chih-wan #248
(1811-97), finished’ as the empire’s optimus in'1847. Determined to emulate
Chih-wan, Chang finished. first’ on the Shun-t’ien. provincial examination
in 1852, but only finished third as (’an-hua on’ the 1863 palace’ examination.
Despite his-success, Chih-tung’s failure to win the coveted status of optimus
was attributed to his early addiction to drinking.*. : ,

Sexual promiscuity also loomed large in the popular view of examina-
tion success. The candidate who abstained from sex’the. night before the
1612 Chiang-nan provincial examination, for instance,.was rewarded with
the highest examination honors; and the ‘one who indulged lost out.” A
jilted woman often returned to haunt a candidate in his examination cell
dooming him to eternal failure. Or,” if she committed suicide, she could
return ‘as a temptress, seduce her tormentor, and‘leave him: for dead."
Another common theme was possession, in which a’ fox-fairy (Au
invaded the candidate’s body and took over his mind. In 1879: for
instance, a fairy began’ speaking in a Chiang-hsi. dialect through the
mouth of a candidate from Hang-chou and had to be appeased

These stories and anecdotes reveal how the complex: institutional

cally were elided in popular culture ‘as: morality tales that fit in with the
themes of fairness and. justice in. government and society. We need. not
accept the historicity of these entertaining chih-kuai collections “recording

reveal, however,. a: general sense. that during. the late empire. elites and
commoners both:accepted the civil examinations as a natural part of life
and infused them with a religious and cosmological narrative that fully
accepted the examination regime and legitimated its place in the: emotion-
al life of the candidates and their families.°° The therapeutic uses of reli-
gion in Ming morality books, which Judith Berling has described as the
“management of moral capital,” carried over to the examination life. ‘The
reorganization of one’s. emotional experiences as an examination. candi-
date accompanied: changes in character:ideals to deal with panic and the
emptiness of failure. These religious tales of examination success or failure
also legitimated the: literati examinations as venues: for Taoist and
Buddhist parables. Popular religion and faith in some compelling symbolic
of self-integrating communal purpose helped men cope with their travails
and understand themselves better.*! a

‘Techniques for Examination Prediction

To cope better with the pressures of the civil examinations and thereby
gain an insight into the nitty-gritty workings of the next examination, can-
didates and their families also used time-honored techniques of communi-
‘atton with the other world to predict. success or failure, to gather clues
about the possible quotations from the Four Books that might be selected
Y examiners, or to divine the riddle that a fortune-teller or dream had

clicited from the gods, spirits, and ancestors. “Reading fate” (k’an-ming &

Fate prediction: was on the minds of many examination candidates.
Based on their acceptance of the Buddhist and Taoist.doctrines of karma
and moral retribution, which had become an accepted part of Ming
examination life, they tried to discern how their “individual fates” (yuar
Jen 34%, lit:, “karmic allotments”) could be calculated using the methods
of fate extrapolation (t’ui-suan tf), auspicious: versus. inauspicious day
selection (chi-hsiung # XI), or the eight-characters (pa-tzu /\*#) of a per
son’s birth. Astrology (chan-hsing 4 Hi), complete with Chinese “hore
scopes,” was widely used by fortune-tellers and Buddhist monks and
Taoist priests. It included milfoil divination based on the Change Classic (F

During the Ming dynasty, for example, fate calculations were so com-
mon that an illustrated seventeenth-century record of all Ming chuang-yuan.
to 1640 included the eight-character, stem-branch (tien-kan ti-chih KF HO
%, lit, “heavenly stems and earthly branches”) combinations for dating
each’s birth by year, month, day, and hour according to the conventional
divination method. The four pairs of stem-branch characters used in the
orthodox calendar (huang-li $4 Jf) and in all almanacs (t’ung-shu #43) were
known as the “four pillars”. (ssu-chu DUE) of one’s fate, and they correlat-
ed with one’s future official position, wealth, and social standing.** The
compilers of the Ming collection added information for each chuang-yuan,
such as bureaucratic rank, punishments received, and early death, where
appropriate, to show the correlations between their birth dates and their
fates. The compilers also added a commentary (“Chuang-yuan ming-tsao
ping-chu” 4k304t HAFRE) to explain the fate calculations for many of the
optimi.°° ,

Fortune-tellers also. employed star-based techniques for, reading fate
(hsing-ming E48) to link an individual’s personal fate to the heavens and
the likelihood of his examination success. These techniques usually incor-
porated astrological signs, each identified with one of twelve animals (rat,
ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and
Pig), which correlated with the twelve earthly branches. For example, an

The Ch’ing scholar-official Wang Chieh * 78 (1725-1805), the optimus
of the 1761 palace examination, for example, had his fate calculated by
Ch’en Hung-mou BR #7 (1696-1771) before the 1759 Shen-hsi. provincial
examination. Ch’en was then governor in Shan-hsi province in the north-
west, and Wang was serving on his secretarial staff. Ch’en told Wang that
the divination had revealed an auspicious result (chia-chao {£38) was in
store for him. Ch’en Hing-mou also told Wang Chiech that the bamboo
slips (chu-ch’ien. ## #8) had revealed Wang’s rank, but~-he wanted to wait
until after the Shen-hsi examination to confirm the prediction.

Surprisingly, Wang did not do well on the 1759 provincial examination
and was placed on the -fu-pang list: of supplementary chii-jen. Ch’en Hung-
mou, it turned out; had correctly seen in the bamboo slips that Wang
would be the eighth-ranking fu-pang. This ranking did not seem auspicious
enough to Wang, and the next year he took the special 1760 Shen-hsi
provincial examination. This time Ch’en Hung-mou guaranteed success,
and he turned out to be right, as Wang finished seventh. By coincidence,
the 1760 chieh-yuan had the same given name Chieh as Wang’s, which the
second divination had also predicted. arn .

When Wang Chieh traveled to Peking to take the metropolitan and
palace examinations, he again consulted with the Change Classic using bam-
boo slips and learned that he would not finish in the top ten on the met:
ropolitan examination but that his fortune was unlimited for the palace.
Ch’en Hung-mou concurred and told Wang that the ‘calculations con
firmed (yu-shu tsat #7 S4£) Wang’s likely final rank as chuang-yuan. Chao I
#4 32 (1727-1814), a Ch’ang-chou #4] literatus who would become 4 dis
tinguished military leader and historian, was Wang’s chief competitor or
top honors in 1761. Chao finished first in the metropolitan examinatio™
while Wang, as predicted, finished eleventh. oe
_ In the palace rankings, the examiners initially ranked Chao
one again and Wang rose to third. The Ch’ien-lung emperor, however
looked over the final list, saw that Wang Chieh was .from Shen-hsh *

province that had, not produced a single optimus under the Ch’ing, while
Chao I came from a prefecture in Chiang-su province with a rich tradi-
tion of chuang-yuan, and he reversed their positions, placing Wang first and
Chao third. Based on the dynasty’s long tradition of regional quotas, the
emperor’s intervention made legitimate political sense. But in light of
Wang’s reliance ‘on the J-ching and his mentor’s divinations, the reversal of
ranks was also viewed by Wang and Ch’en as a legitimate act of fate. The
emperor had acted to confirm the prescience of the other world.®
Indeed, Chao .I’s remarkable equanimity in the face of this sudden
reversal was also. read as a sign of his acceptance of his fate, although
Chao himself considered: his ties to the Grand Council, where he had
clerked, as the political reason he had been demoted. Chao bemoaned the
fact that he had been too well connected. He maintained that the Chi’en-
lung emperor had not wanted to show favoritism toward a clerk of the
prestigious grand councilors. In 1754 there had been an example of some-
one who had not‘so rationalized his fate. Ch’ii Li-chiang #2271, whose
family also lived in’ Ch’ang-chou prefecture in Chiang-su province, had
ranked third on the metropolitan and was preliminarily named the optimus
on the palace examination.. However, when the chief examiner suddenly
switched Ch’ii’s name with the third name on the palace list, his fellow
townsman Chuang P’ei-yin £34) (1723-59), Ch’ii became so distressed
that he died on the spot, allegedly from aggravation. If Ch’ti, unlike Chao
I, was emotionally. unable to accept his sudden reversal of fortune, the
Chuangs, also from Ch’ang-chou prefecture, had earlier proven that they
d paid their moral dues to the demons of fate in the examination mar-

finisher, P’eng Ch’i-feng 8% &'4! (1701-84) from Su-chou, who had been
the metropolitan Aut-yuan. The Yung-cheng emperor had directly inter-
vened in the final’ rankings because on recent palace: examinations
Chiang-su graduates had dominated the top rankings for ‘chin-shih, and he
wanted to select an optimus from a border province instead. He mistakenly
thought that someone with the surname of P’eng was likely from outside
the Yangtzu delta. When he discovered that P’eng Ch’i-feng was from Sv-
chou, the cultural center of the Yangtzu delta; the Yung-cheng emperor
declined to make another change and decided he could still use the occa-

found the Chuangs and P’engs to be equal.’It was only in their “cherish-

Chuangs. Because the P’eng lineage had properly collected, cleansed, and

ular religion,’ which were deemed more important than the cultural
resources they had invested in a classical education for their sons. This
tale of good works and moral retribution later carried over to the previ-
ously unfortunate Ch’ lineage in Ch’ang-chou prefecture as well. Before
the 1814 metropolitan examination, for instance, Ch’ii Jung #74 (Chi-
chien #4 3K), a grandson of the tragic Ch’i Li-chiang, dreamed that
Chuang P’ei-yin had appeared before him and presented Jung with a
stem of apricot blossoms saying, “We are returning to your family some-
thing that belongs to them.” This auspicious offering implied that the
Chuangs were repaying Ch’ii Jung for the events of sixty years earlier that
had led to his grandfather’s unexpected death.” As a result, Ch’ii finished
first on the metropolitan and fifth overall on the palace examination.
Moral retribution: was also served by Ch’ii Jung’s finishing ahead of Liu
Feng-lu $3#%: (1776-1829), the last important scion by his. mother of the
distinguished Chuang tradition of New Text (chin-wen 4> 30) classical learn-
ing in Ch’ang-chou, who ranked only thirty-sixth. In this cautionary tale
of trial and tribulation for the competitive sons of illustrious lineages in
Ch’ang-chou, closure-had been reached. All their allotments of fate had
been spent, and good works had triumphed.”

The rituals of spirit-writing (fu-chi $k AL), in which a.spirit medium. pas-
sively transmitted spirit messages by means of a divining instrument, had
been applied to civil examinations since the T’ang and Sung dynasties.
During the Sung, fu-chi involved the composition of poetry and other liter-
ary forms, which required mediums to be masters of the poetic forms
used in the belles lettres portions of the examinations.” By the late Ming,
although the civil examinations no longer required poetry, this method of
communicating with the other world was also used to produce books of
moral teachings authored by the spirits themselves. It was both “natural”
me culturally acceptable for examination candidates on their way to a

was also common for. the audience to assume that the spirit who wrote
through the planchette was a famous poet or writer from the past.”

For example, a candidate on his way to the 1688 metropolitan exami-
nation in Peking stopped to ask'a medium to communicate with the “writ.
ing spirit” (pi-shen 3©##) and ask it to predict the upcoming quotations
from the Four Books that would appear on the first session of the exami-
_ nation. The spirit replied via the medium by writing on the planchette the
two characters for “I don’t know” (pu-chth 7S Hil)..The candidate then
asked the spirit: “How is it that the spirits and worthies have no way of
knowing?” The medium then recorded the spirit’s second reply: “I don’t
know. I'don’t know. And again:I don’t know” (AV Hl > ANH > MASA.

Meanwhile,.a crowd had gathered in the temple, : which probably
included other examination candidates. They were all amused at the spir-
it’s apparent: profession of ignorance and remained unenlightened. When
the candidate was in his examination cell, however, he suddenly realized
that the spirit had indeed correctly predicted what the first quotation from
the Four Books would be. It was.taken from the last chapter of Confucius’
Analects, which included three “I don’t knows” in the quotation: “Confu-
cius said, ‘Not knowing fate, a man has no way of becoming a gentleman;
not knowing the rites, he has.no way of taking a stand; not knowing
words, he has no way’ of judging people” (FLA > AAA > se LB BT
tH, © RANG > FELIZ te AAA > HLA A ©). The required quotation
for the first eight-legged essay, of course, included: the phrase. “pu-chih”
three times. The failure of the candidate to recognize what the spirit was
telling him also demonstrated his deficiencies as a gentleman who did not
know his own fate.”* ; , so

Among the interesting cultural developments that set the classical and
literary context for sessions of spirit-writing were changes in the actu
curriculum of the civil examinations over the centuries. In.the turn from
T’ang-Sung belles lettres .to Ming-Ch’ing classical essays, described 1
Chapter 1, not only did candidates have to adjust their. study of the classt-
cal canon; but spirits (particularly their mediums!) also. had to keep UP
with the classical curriculum if they hoped to provide the proper guidance
when implored for a prediction of examination questions. Hence, from
1370 until poetry testing was resumed in 1756, it made little linguistic sense
for mediums to transmit specific poetry lines when queried. about the

examinations. Their opinions on most matters, however, still were expressed

using poetic forms.’> Ci
[ronically, one way to trace the changes in the examination curriculum

from Sung through Ch’ing times is to follow the changes in the content of

the responses: spirits “wrote out” on planchettes for candidates. In ‘a local
temple, for instance, a candidate once asked the medium there to predict
the questions for the upcoming 1843 Che-chiang provincial examination.
Suddenly Kuan-ti took hold of the medium and wrote out on the
planchette a reply that alluded to the likely questions, but Kuan-ti also
added: “I do not read the Spring and Autumn Annals.” ‘The candidate didn’t
know what this meant until, while taking the second session of the provin-
cial examination, which after 1787 required candidates to master all of the
Five Classics (see Chapter 5), he noted that Kuan-ti had successfully pre-
dicted the quotations from the Change, Documents, Poetry, and Rites classics.
Only the quotation from the Annals was missing from Kuan-ti’s prediction,
which suggested. that Kuan-ti (or the medium) had preferred it. when the
curriculum had allowed candidates to specialize on one of the Classics.
Before 1756, few candidates, like Kuan-ti, had mastered the Annals because

of the length of its commentaries (see Tables 5.16 and 5.17).”°
As we shall see in Chapter 10, the period after 1740 was replete with
changes in the civil.examination curriculum, including the addition of a
tequired poetry question in T’ang regulated verse in 1756. Judith Zeitlin
has described, for. example, the bafflement of the Han Learning scholar
Chi Yun #24 (1724-1805) when he and a group of scholars consulted a
spint-writing medium near West Lake in Hang-chou in the late eighteenth
Rn The poem that appeared through the medium alluded to a
‘mous medieval courtesan and poet whose grave site was nearby and

who they thought was probably the actual spirit writing the poem.” ..

What troubled Chi Yun was that the poem the spirit composed was

comme, did via the medium. Still not convinced that the spirit they were

was being impersonated by an unknown ghost from a’ later period, one
who knew T’ang regulated verse very well. And, we might add, one who
could provide late eighteenth-century examination candidates with predic.
tions of the lines of T’ang verse needed for the new poetry question,”

Similar to spirit-writing, the technique known’ as “deciphering written
words” (ch’ai-izu HF or ts’e-tzu ills), which came from a medium or
appeared in a dream, replicated the six paleographical rules of written
graph formation. In use in China since the Shuo-wen chieh-tzu #3 #
(Analysis of characters as an explanation of writing) by Hsu Shen #14
(58-147), the rules had classified almost’ten thousand different characters
by sound and structure according to 530 radicals (pu-shou #8 #4). Such
philologically technical word analysis was appropriated in popular culture
by fortune-tellers and diviners to decipher the cryptic messages often
received via spirit-writing.”? Tee!

The semantic, radical component of a’ graph and its: complementary,
phonetic component, which had been used together by: classical scholars
to determine the ancient meaning of the graph, could be turned inside out
by clever predictors of fate, who broke characters down into their struc-
tural components and then recombined them in efforts to fathom the
secret message or pun that was being transmitted through them. In 1406,
for example, the Fu-chien literatus Lin Huan #32 dreamed (see Figure
6.3) that when he was about to take the spring metropolitan and palace
examinations; his friend sent him some dog meat (ch’tian-jou X (A). Later,
Lin realized that this had been an auspicious omen (hsien-chao 7636) and
that he had been destined by fate to become the 1406 optimus. ;

When the character ch’tian % for dog was analyzed by Lin and his
Hanlin colleagues, they saw first that it was-the right'side of the character
for chuang #K in chuang-yuan IRIE (optimus). Second, the character for 408
was itself both the organizing. radical and the. first character under the
radical for chuang 4k. These two methods of ch’ai-tzu- confirmed that Lin
Huan had been assured of becoming the chuang-yuan: In essence;
approach gave free rein to-the imagination to construct plausible, ad hoe
“dissections” of characters to suit the immediate needs of the interpreter.

This technique could also be used to predict future success OF fa

Because so much in fate calculations depended on one’s birth date and
identity, another common technique that candidates used was to change
their fates or escape an inauspicious spirit-writing session ‘by modifjng
their names. A name change served candidates as an ‘identity change
which could reconfigure their karmic allotments. Or the change could
allow them to take advantage of an auspicious fate awaiting someone who
met the criteria of a particular surname or given name. To dream of the
heavenly rankings” (tien-pang KF), as many candidates did, was to see

the final earthly rankings in advance.®? In many cases, the change of
name was simply a strategic. decision based on a prophetic dream or a
political decision to avoid possible misunderstandings if one’s name cat-
ried double meanings. - .
For example, Yuan Huang, who believed that “success in the examina-
tions depends entirely on secret virtue,” failed the 157 “metropolitan
examination when he registered under his given name of Yuan Liao-fan
53 Lf Ju. Later he dreamed that someone named Yuan Huang  % W4S
destined to be the Aui-yuan, so Liao-fan changed his name to Huang. On
the 1586 palace examination, as “Yuan Huang,” he indeed gained his
chin-shih degree ranked number 190, but he was only ranked 185th behind
the * top two finishers on the metropolitan examination, Yuan Tsung-¥°
32 AI (1560-1600) and Huang Ju-liang #2Kf. The dream, it tured
out, had correctly predicted the surnames of the top. two metropolitan
finishers, Yuan and Huang. Yuan Tsung-tao, like Yuan Huang, was also 4
practitioner of Taoist and Buddhist cultivation techniques.

In 1690 Lu Tsu-yii RE2H/R was told by an examiner to change his
name if he expected to pass under Manchu rule, because his earlier name,
Hsi-man §K38 (“present plentiful gifts”), was slightly embarrassing an
could imply “to use Manchus for sacrifice.” Because of this, Lu’s name

was not placed. on the official. chiijen roll, although the examiner had
wanted to rank him one of the top five finishers. Lu had also dreamed
that someone else had told him to change his name if he. hoped to gain a
higher degree. As a fu-pang alternate, Lu was able to compete in higher
examinations successfully after changing his name to Tsu-yi.

In another case, the great-great-grandson of -Ch’en Hung-mou, Ch’en
Chi-ch’ang BE 42, took his chi-jen degree ranked number one under. the
name Shou-jui *f #{, but for the. 1820 metropolitan examination, based. on
a dream, he changed his name to Chi-ch’ang. ‘The result. was.that he
finished first on both the metropolitan and palace examinations. Based on
an auspicious dream, Ch’en became one. of only two Ch’ing literati (see
Chapter 7) to finish first .on all provincial and capital examinations (under
the name Chi-ch’ang).. He also was ranked number one.on his three local
examinations (under the name Shou-jui) and thus was known as holder of
“greater and lower” (ta-hsiao K/)) “three firsts” (san-yuan =F),

For a final example, consider the case of Wei Yun-ko 323574, who
dreamed he saw the heavenly rankings (#’en-pang K #) for the 1821 Che-
chiang provincial examination. The first name onthe roll was a literatus
from Hang-chou with the name Wei Shih-lung $&-C#8. After checking to
see that there was no one registered from Hang-chou with the name Shih-
lung, Wei Yun-ko changed his name to ‘correspond to the heavenly rank-
ings, The heavenly rankings had ‘not indicated what year the roll referred
to, however, so; as Wei Shih-lung, Wei Yun-ko failed the 1821 provincial
examination, He had to wait until 1844 for the prophecy to come true,
and as Wei Shih-lung he finally finished as the Che-chiang chieh-yuan that

Similarly, the use of geomancy (feng-shui JE\7K) to locate auspicious sit

Famous geomancers were much sought after because of their success in
selecting auspicious ancestral lands. Such grave sites were thought to yield
examination success as ‘well, given the carryover between the generations

to draw on such techniques, which added to the repertoire of popular reli-

_ DREAMS AND ASPIRATIONS
OF MING CHUANG-YUAN

As shown above, perhaps the most representative form of communication
between this and the. other. world since antiquity in China was the
dream.” Dream interpretations (chan-meng_ 4 38) and the sighting of por-
tents (chao 6) in the dreams of examination candidates, common in
medieval China,” became sophisticated cultural forms widely reported in
Ming times.*! Even Chu Yuan-chang, the first emperor of the Ming, had
recorded one of his own dreams (“Chi-meng” #2), which was collected
in his imperial writings. In the dream, Chu relived his life one year before
becoming.emperor, in which there had been several signs that he was des-

fined to unite China under. his military forces. The signs for his success
were laid out in his dream as they were in popular religion and literati
life. First a fairy crane sent by the immortals appeared in Chu’s dream
and led him into visions of Buddhist guardians and Taoist priests. The
priests presented him with a crimson robe and a sword. They then told
him to move on.. The dream in effect legitimated the rags-to-riches. tale. of
a peasant boy who.was designated by the other, darker world to become
the founder of.a new, “bright” (ming. H).dynasty in the visible world.

As spontaneous reflections of the anxiety in their lives, produced under
the enormous. mental and-physical pressures of the civil examination
regime and, for them, its “cultural prisons,”. the visions that late imperial
literati projected in dreams provide us with a unique window: to gauge
their mental world, as they recalled it, through. language and visual imagery
for interpretation by fortune-tellers, diviners, shamans, and Buddhist and
Taoist priests. The dream market for examinations, which involved “sleep
meditation” as a religious form, was. a faithful replica of the cultural con-
structions that accompanied the social and political dynamics of the exam-
ination market.23 Frequently, these exchanges, which resulted in personal
gains and losses, were expressed in humorous terms. 7

For instance, the poet’and calligrapher Ho Shao-chi . i] 48 2& (1799-
1873), some time: before the 1820 metropolitan examination in Peking,
had a dream in.which he reached a market where there were many
man-t’ou #8 9 (steamed rolls). After choosing one roll to eat and finish-
ing it, he took another, when suddenly a stranger came by and stole it
from him. Later, Ho realized that the man-t’ou thief was none other than
the 1820 optimus. Ch’en Chi-ch’ang BE #2 A, who, as we have seen,
changed his name after taking first place in the provincial examination
and thereby was assured of finishing first on both the palace and the met-
Topolitan examinations. Ho realized that he had met his match, as the
dream had suggested. Ho finished first on the 1835 provincial examina-
tion, which counted for the man-t’ou he had eaten in the dream, but in the
oe metropolitan.and palace examinations he could not duplicate Ch’en
sehang’s feat of “three firsts,’ two under the name Chi-ch’ang. The

man-t’ou went to Ch’en.”*

Ch’en Shih-yuan’s BR-£7G 1562 compilation entitled Meng-chan i-chth e
ERE (Remaining points on dream interpretation) laid out in rich histor-
ical detail the two major traditions of dream interpretation in imperial
China: (1) the dream as prophecy (chao Yk). and (2) the dream as illusion
(huan x). In the examination market, unlike the literary world, the dream
functioned mainly as a form of communication with. the other world.
Although different, dreams and conscious perception (chueh #8) were forms
of realization that added to human knowledge (chih Ml) of fate and prog-
nostication. In Ch’en’s view, “there were early auspicious signs for all
examination rankings and salary grades” (FFAS dn de AA HIE). He then
traced the written evidence from the T’ang through Ming times for
dreams as auspicious signs of examination success.*? ;

At least five Ming emperors .reputedly relied on dreams to choose the
optimus, for-example, in the -palace examination. In 1385 the Hung-wu
emperor, whose own famous dream was recorded as an autobiographical
account of his fated ascent to power, dreamed of nails (ting $J) and silk
thread (ssu #4) and therefore chose Ting Hsien T FA as the chuang-yuan.
The reasoning was: (1) Ting’s surname was the same sound as the charac-
ter for nails and (2) the character for silk thread formed part of Hsien’s
name. In 1421, the Yung-lo emperor reportedly dreamed of a crane (ho
#), a symbol for Taoist immortals, before the palace examination. Based
on this omen, he selected ‘Tseng Ho-ling pa gag as the optimus because
Tseng’s name included the graph for a crane.

Later in 1448, the Cheng-t’ung emperor dreamed of meeting a litera-
tus, a Taoist, and a Buddhist before the palace examination. He then
chose the top three. chin-shih based on their intellectual backgrounds: ‘The
Chang juan Peng Shih #2 8 (1416-75) was registered from a hereditary lit-
ote bey (ju-chi #§#); the pang-yen Ch’en Chien BREE (1415-71) had
Chen een a student of music in a Taoist temple; and the tan-hua Yueh

In a discourse that narrated communications between tempo:

accounts of imperial dreams. Many were: imperial fabrications; whe
were imputed to the ruler; but even as fabrications, the dreams re re ne
ed- cultural. accounts: that drew on historical events and molded then n
the morality tale being told. It was reported, for instance, that Yu Ch’ i.
had appeared as a ghost before his banished wife and asked to borrow het
eyes so that he could appear normal before the emperor. and plead his
case. In the morning Yii’s wife became blind, while Yii himself appeared
before the emperor as an image in a fire that broke out in the imperial
palace. Realizing the injustice done to Yii in 1457, the emperor pardoned
his wife. It was patently a false dream, however; the Ch’eng-hua emperor
could not have pardoned her, because Yii’s wife had passed away years
before while.in exile. He did rehabilitate the Yii name and allow the son
of Wang Wen XC (1393-1457), also martyred in 1457;’to-take the civil
éxaminations in 1465) (see Chapter 8). The fabrication of the dream did,
however, explain that policy decision and right the wrong: done to Yi
Ch ien, and thus itis useful to us historically as a lie about how things
ideally should have appeared.!"" a Lee

We also know that dream interpretation played a significant role in the
lives of more than half of all chuang-yuan during the Ming dynasty.”
Dreams were interpreted as human “counterparts” (hsiang. &; see Chapter

was in vogue during the Ming. .
Such premonitory dreams of success were widely written about and
were illustrated in. the uniquely Ming woodblock form of portraying
dreams graphically as a “vision” of consciousness that emanated from the
mind while the body was asleep.'® Astrological signs such as the southern
dipper, auspicious omens such as dog meat, and unusual coincidences fed
into the Ming belief that the mind at rest tended to weave a cultural
matrix of visual images and symbols whose surface aspects could be stud-
‘ed for the manifest content they implied. These dream-visions may be in-
terpreted as historical constructions and not as actual dreams whose riddles
need deciphering. It is likely that ail were ad hoc constructions and not mani-
fest dreams, as they were presented. It is worth making the Ming solutions
to the riddle of the dreams the object of analysis to see how such dreams
and their cultural interpretations functioned in the examination market.'°
For our purposes, the “manifest content” of this cultural matrix was
channeled in part by the male anxiety and. motivating psychological ten-
sions that the examination life entailed. Although the. “latent dream-
thoughts” of chuang-yuan will never be transparent to us because they were
always encoded, transposed, revised, and distorted in the manifest cultural
discourse peculiar to Ming China, we can begin to decode some external
aspects of the interrelation between the psychological makeup of the men
and families who claimed to have had such dreams and their sociohistori-
cal experiences and pressures. Their repressions and sublimations were far
different from those we. can. intuit today because the cultural terms of
their Conscious acceptance and rejection of their thoughts were defined by
we times and not ours. Indeed, to call their mental streams of conscious-
selves seams, repressions,” or “sublimations” tells us more about our-

Figure 6.4 presents a late Ming woodblock illustration prepared by
Huang Ying-ch’eng for the Ming chuang-yuan t’u-k’ao in which three heads
(jen-shou san ko AW =A) appear in a.1445 dream-vision. The print rep-
resents a dream, actually a “day-dream,” that Shang Lu 7 # (1414-86)
reportedly had while a young man reading the classics in his family’s
study (hsueh-she 4 2), probably sometime before 1435. ‘The published
account of it indicates that his teacher, a man named “literatus Hung” #
+, had been living. with -him in his room, helping him prepare for the
civil examinations. The elegant setting of the study, his.neat reading desk
complete with the writing paraphernalia required of all calligraphers (see
Chapter 5), and the fact that he had a live-in tutor all indicate that
Shang’s Che-chiang family was one. of substantial means and. could pro-
vide him the time and cultural resources needed to devote to his classical
studies. This was not a rags-to-riches story.'°? .

In the illustration, however, Shang Lu is not pictured hard at work,
which would have been the usual image of his mental preparations on the
toad to classical literacy and future examination success. Instead, he is
portrayed asleep while studying, his teacher is absent, and from Shang’s
head emanates a dream-vision of a man holding three heads laced togeth-
er by their hair, which the man presents to Shang..We should explore a
litle further the cultural overlap between “three heads” and “three firsts,”
which in both Chinese and English are: homologous. Curiously, . the
Chinese term for head used in the dream is shou # and not ¢’ou Bf, the
more physical image of the. head attached to. the body, ‘although both

enemies and presented them to their leader as a trophy to confirm total
victory in battle. Or, we might note that decapitation was a legal measur
the Ming dynastic code enforced in capital cases if the crime were deter.
mined to be a “heavy” one, as opposed to a “lighter” one, ‘which would
entail death by strangulation or slicing. Perhaps the military and legal
readings of Shang Lu’s' dream have ‘some very limited relevance in evel
ing the examination market, where to compete and win meant that others
had to fail.. Lacking the detailed information that would: tell us more
about the dream’s latent characteristics, however, we are left with its
placid manifest content as pictured by the late Ming compilers. It is by
Ming cultural standards definitely not:a troubling dream, and we should
_ not read too much ‘blood and gore into it.!'° ee

Upon awakening, Shang Lu immediately related the manifest content
of the dream to his teacher, who instead. of scolding him for falling asleep
while studying tells him that it is an “auspicious dream”: (chi-meng & ¥).
The “three heads” are a vision into the future.of Shang’s'life as: a candi-
date for the civil examinations. With hindsight, of course, the dream at
face value is easy enough to decipher. Shang’s preordained’ success was
corroborated when, at the'age of twenty-one, he passed the 1435 Che-chi-
ang provincial examination ranked first. He followed: that up ten years
later as the number-one graduate on the metropolitan, and received the
final of his “three heads” by being named chuang-yuan on the 1445 palace
examination. Shang was to that point the only literatus:who had achieved
“three firsts”: (san-yuan =7C)-on the Ming civil examinations. Because of
his own. influence as an examiner, Shang would see to it that another
aspiring challenger; Wang Ao -= % (1450-1524), would ‘not duplicate the
feat, and for the Ming, only Shang Lu attained this exclusive civil exami-
nation height (see Chapter 7). ee fot

Read with hindsight as ad hoc rationalization, Shang Lu’s dream pr
sents his success as a natural outcome of fate. The hard work and classical
memory required to achieve such unprecedented success are elided in
favor of a smooth path to fame, fortune, and high political office." Read
more historically, however, the placid dream covers up what must have
been the considerable worries Shang had when, after passing the 1439
provincial examination, he probably failed the 1436, 1439, and 144? met-

ropolitan examinations. Given that he was over twenty in 1435, Shang

probably also” had failed the highly competitive Che-chiang provincial
examination a couple of times, in addition to failing the metropolitan
examination perhaps three times. Like most candidates (see Chapter 5),
then, Shang had to wait until he was in his thirties before he received the
coveted chin-shth degree and entered the civil service. :

The story of preordained success becomes. more problematic when the
failures are added to the record. Forgotten are the childhood years of
memorization (Shang specialized on the Documents Classic, for example)
and youthful days spent in the study reading widely and practicing exami-
nation essays. In fact, the metropolitan record of the 1445 examination
indicates that Shang’s eight-legged essays were not particularly outstand-
ing. Not one of his three essays on the Four Books was picked as the best.
Only one of his four essays on quotations from the Documents was selected.
Shang made his mark by writing the best discourse and documentary
papers on session two, and one of his policy essays on session three was
also chosen as the best on that question. For the late Ming audience, the
single dream-vision replaced those hours, days, months, and years of hard
work and disregarded the closeness of the competition for the high honors
that Shang had been very fortunate to win."!? )

A similar dream, recorded by the 1583 optimus Chu Kuo-tso 4 BU#f, is
depicted as a dream-vision in Figure 6.5. In their commentary, the late
Ming compilers of the Chuang-yuan t’u-k’ao noted that as a young candidate
Chu had been on-his way home from a local examination in T’ung-chou
when a friend invited him on his boat, and they began drinking. Later at
a stop along the way, the friend dragged Chu into a wine house filled
with prostitutes. Alarmed, Chu ran out the door and without stopping
walked the twenty & back to T’ung-chou. Later, when Chu took the
Provincial examination, he had a dream in his studio, again a daydream,

~ When mantic techniques failed to produce. the expected effects, however
: ’

profound disillusionment often followed. Many assailed the pervasive uses
of divination, geomancy, and dream interpretation in the examination
market as misplaced reliance on the other world. Similar sentiments were
repeated inside Ming examination halls. The reign of cults, gods, spirits,
and the mantic techniques to communicate with them was challenged by
many metropolitan and provincial examiners, -who used the political
precincts of the dynasty’s “cultural ‘prisons” to place limits on elite belief
in popular notions of fate and communication with the other world. The
institutional regime of examinations enforced examiner power to lide
nonofficial beliefs.'2!. For instance, in the third-session policy questions
(whose range of content is detailed in Chapter 9); examiners at times
raised the issue of natural anomalies (tsai-i $€ #2) and asked students how
to account for.such.events.!22 ,

The 1558 Shun-t’ien Provincial Examination
and Interpretation of Natural Anomalies

Representative of the elite trend to profess publicly its distance from pop
lar religion and the mantic arts, the 1558 policy question on anomalies
which were usually seen as inauspicious natural disasters, was adminis
tered by examiners in charge of the Shun-t’ien provincial examination

reared to answer :two policy questions on natural studies indicates that
the provincial examinations in the late Ming exerted a broad influence on
students preparing for the examinations by having them study aspects 0
the “Chinese sciences” (see Chapter 9).'* oe

The examiners began their question by addressing the overlap betwen
the heavenly and human realms and the subtle principles underlying is
overlap. Citing the “Hung-fan” #4 #8 (Great plan) chapter of the Documents
Classic as the locus classicus, the examiners asked candidates to explain
how the “five matters” (w2-shih 7.4) in human affairs corresponded to
the “five phases” (wu-hsing 7.47) in the heavenly order. In many other
civil examinations, these issues were raised by focusing on the five phases
themselves.! . oo

Since antiquity, literati as officials had debated the role of natural disas-
ters in society and their impact on politics. Discussion of this issue usually
lay within the limits of the boundaries first demarcated by Hsun-tzu aif
in the Warring States era and later substantially revised by Tung Chung-
shu Bf {#4 (179-104 B.c.), who, as a result of his persuasive examination
Policy essays (hsien-liang - san-ts’e. & fl = 5), became one of the most
influential advisors in the Former Han.” For Hsun-tzu, the spheres 0
heaven and man interacted, but the latter’s destiny depended on man’s
own abilities to govern effectively. Anomalies were odd (kuai chth Ko yeh FE

(ch’ien #8) arising from errors in the dynasty (fan tsai-i chth pen chin sheng yi
kuo-chia chih shih Pu 8322 A BEAL HS BAZ 4).18 In this 1558 question
the examiners were asking candidates to define what the “overlap between
heaven and people” (tien-jen chih chi K AZ PH meant for contemporary
Ming literati. : Oe

What was at stake here were the dangers of indulging too readily in the
arts of communication between the real and unseen worlds. The 1558
examiners asked: ve

How can the resonance between the five phases and five matters be demon-
strated? .To observe the overlap, some use. the year, others -the:-moon, and
-still others the day. How does one divide: things up like this? Next,
Confucius :in preparing the Spring and Autumn Annals recorded calamities as
inauspicious, but why didn’t he record the corresponding events? In com-
menting on this some have said that Confucius feared that if there was no
overlap then others would not have believed in the overlap. Is this right or
wrong?!?9 Q

Here the examiners were referring to Ou-yang Hsiu’s Bk Bit (1007-72)
discussion of anomalies in the Annals in his Hsin Trang-shu’ 3 FB # (New
history of the T’ang dynasty). There, Ou-yang described Confucius as
very cautious in his efforts to links events on earth to the heavens.
Confucius regarded disasters (tsai $8) and inauspicious events @ ®) as
omens (ch’ien jl), according to Ou-yang Hsiu, which rightfully instilled
fear and the need for moral cultivation (K’ung-chti hsiu-hsing 7 #816 #). Ow

Candidates were asked to assess the interpretation of anomalies given DY

Finally, the question turned to the manipulation of calamities as jnaus-
picious political events by Han dynasty officials during the first century
B.C., when prognostication and prophecy based on ch’en-wet BL AE (apor

“purely political." Believing in the conjuncture between abnormal nat-
ural phenomena and sociopolitical life, Han officials used this belief as an
ideological weapon in the political struggles of the times. While Eberhard
overstates the case and overlooks the technical achievements made by
Han calendrical specialists in determining lunations and accurately pre-
dicing lunar eclipses, it is nonetheless clear that the Ming examiners were
exposing this Han predilection for omens to ask - students : what they
thought of the effort to link politics to anomalies in imperial gover-
nance? 20 re OO os -
Among the examples the Ming examiners raised were those of Kung-
sun Hung 2 54 (d. 121 B.c.), Kung-sun Ching 5), Ching Fang 5%
FE (79-37 3.c.);;and.I Feng 38 4, all high officials who had been ques-
tioned by Han emperors about the meaning of natural calamities or
anomalies. When asked why floods had occurred in Yii’s &% reign (tr.,
gid mill. B.c.), for example, -Kung-sun Hung had replied that virtue and
anomalies were’ mutually exclusive. and that “if one accorded with heaven’s
virtue then harmony arose, if one opposed it, calamity struck” (K S48 4
Ro WAZA > Wie Be). ere
Likewise the Han ‘official Kung-sun Ch’ing had explicated the reasons
why natural disasters ‘such as droughts occurred, while Ching Fang, who
was exiled for his alleged crimes as a Han minister, predicted a great del-

uge and was imprisoned. and: executed when his prediction came to —

pass,!%4 I Feng had replied to an emperor concerned about calamities dur-
ing his reign that “heaven’s heart determined whether the kingly way was
peaceful or endangered” (BRD A EM ZESE). Most. of these views
could be discredited ( pu tsu ch’eng 7 }2 4), the examiners implied in their
question, but: the students were asked if there was anything of note to

--When viewed in‘light of the mantic arts then prevalent in Ming cultur-
al life, the 1558 Shun-t’ien examiners were cutting against’ the grain of
public culture in Peking and elsewhere that surrounded the examination
compound in which the question was delivered. The popular correlate to
the role of anomaly interpretation by Han officials criticized ‘by the exam-
iners was the effort by examination candidates to divine: their futures via
the mantic arts. The way the collected dreams of optimi, which reflected
popular lore in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, were honored as
biographical. sources indicates that literati communication’ with the other
world was more tolerated in government and: society than in’ the halls and
cells of the civil examinations. wh

Since the Han, the records of “anomalies” had been featured in a var-
ety of private and official writings ‘that sought to: domesticate the other
world by fixing its unusual impact on everyday life within a taxonomy
known as chih-kuai_ i #8 (recording unusual events). Indeed, following the
fall of the Han in a.p. 220, anomaly records were shifted from the “small
writings”: (hsiao-shuo ’/|\ i) section in the canon of “philosophers” (tzu-pu
#8) to the section on “histories” (shth-pu 2 #4). After the T’ang, when the
civil examinations were reconstituted and expanded, the accounts in many
t-wen lu SX BESR (records of unusual matters) that we discussed above
focused on the examination compounds and the mental life of candidates
which in effect became an important subgenre in the chih-kuai category."
These: accounts mounted in number and by Sung: times were’ widely

prevalent in encyclopedias such as the ‘Tai-p’ing kuang-chi K F ie
(Expanded records of the T’ai-p’ing era), completed in 977, and in ae
form literature” ( pi-chi 4¢#2). Daiwie Fu has examined the evolution ]
the anomaly accounts in Northern Sung times and found that in genet
there was a tendency among Sung literati such as Shen Kua Ud:
(1031-95) to revise the T’ang categorization of natural anomalies by ie
tancing themselves from such records of ghosts and divine spirits. In

en. Similarly, those who say that people have planned: earthly affairs to
accord with calamities are slandering men. These are all instances of seek

e did not force events to fit the notion that calamities were preor-
dained. Wu further explained: “Therefore, J think those who discuss
calamities and inauspicious events must use the Annals as their standard.
Confucius’ intent was true, and his words were straight. The. chronicle
was verified according to unchanging principles.”!?

Coming to the part of the question dealing with the calamities that had
beset the sage-kings Yao and T’ang, Wu Shao noted that the lack of such
calamities in later reigns did not mean that Yao or T’ang were deficient
in morality. Rather, the problem lay in the operations of chi 3A (the mate-
tial/spiritual ‘world of matter and energy), which was unified in its opera-
tions between heaven and’ earth. Sometimes it acted in harmony with
people; at other times it went against them. Even a sage-king such as Yao
or T’ang could not contro! the operations of ch’ when they went against
the ruler’s will. Later reigns were more fortunate in living in a time when
the operations of ch% were more harmonious. Rather than fear such
events, according to Wu Shao, the gentleman understood that “heaven
has its Way, and men have their efficacy.” Fear of the workings of the
universe could be tamed and brought within the framework of self-control
and self-scrutiny in the realm of human affairs.'**

To explain why calamities occurred (so-i-jan it LA #8), Wu Shao
appealed to the subtle revolutions of the heavenly Way, which were
beyond the ken of humans. The great virtuous power of heaven favored
life, but even heaven could not stand in the way of the workings of the
Way, when heaven’s heart was moved by the plight of men caught up in

This policy question and its answer, typical of the cosmological outlook
favored in written examinations, were pervaded by:a distancing orienta-
tion to natural calamities and were clearly opposed ‘to what were called
disjoined” (pu-ho AX 4) interpretations of nature. Limitations in the
human understanding of the cosmos, according to both the-examiners and
candidate, had to be recognized. Otherwise, to’ impute human meaning
intent to calamities, as prognostication and the mantic arts presumed,
was to humanize heaven and translate human knowledge into human fear
and ignorance. Furthermore, the candidate’s appeal to sage-kings as men
who confronted the events of their time and rectified them indicated that
notions of fate implying resignation in the face of calamities were una
ceptable for orthodox literati operating in the public domain. What mat
tered was not the symbolic meaning of floods or droughts but rather what
concrete policies were followed to deal with them. Governance by mé?
took precedence in a world in which the complete workings of heaven
were beyond one’s understanding.

world, were never. successfully resolved in the late empire. Although
increasingly evident in the Ch’ing, literati dissatisfaction with the ‘inroads
that popular religion and the mantic world of diviners, fortune-tellers, and
Taoist priests had made in Ming-examination life was already foreshad-

owed during the sixteenth century. 7 ,
The Che-chiang scholar-bibliophile Hu Ying-lin #4 RE BF (1551-1602),
for example, became a chii-jen degree-holder in 1576, but between 1577 and
1598 he failed the ‘metropolitan examination eight times. His distaste for
the examination system carried over into his private life, during which he
read widely and began writing fiction at the age of fifteen. In 1594-95,
while he stayed in Peking preparing for his seventh attempt at the chin-shih
degree in spring 1595, Hu recorded one of his dreams, which, in effect
became a parody of the dream-visions so popular among examination
candidates.© .. . / ' oe
Under the heading “Examiners in Heaven” (“T’ien-shang chu-ssu” RK
£8), Hu Ying-lin related that the night before the.1595 metropolitan
examination he had dreamed of an officially dressed man sitting above
him in the palace, who invited him to enter and take the examination.
When Hu entered the palace examination, he found that a man named I-
shui sheng (4 7K 4E, lit., “Master Change-Water”) was already seated.
When only one sheet of paper with the examination questions ,on it
floated down from the examiner, Hu struggled with the other man to
catch it. Master Change-Water succeeded in catching the paper, although
Hu could make out seven characters on. the sheet. After falling short on
Ve heavenly examination, Hu awoke angrily and remained ill at. ease.
en the first session of the actual metropolitan examination com-
menced, Hu was surprised to see that. the. seven characters he .had
eimpsed in his dream, if properly interpreted, would have correctly pre-
sted the first quotation. : my

ang §.
Such a backhanded critique of the heavenly examiner permitted Hu to
conclude: “If the heavenly examiner was illiterate, how much better could
the earthly examiners be?”!47_—_- - .

Hu Ying-lin' effectively turned the typical Ming dream interpretation
inside out and cast doubt on the credibility of the other world. His parody
of the dream satirized the mantic arts, which had given the other world
precedence over the human realm. ‘In the'end, all Hu could do, however,
was’'to throw up his hands in disgust and’ retire’ to private life.
Nevertheless, his views echoed sentiments among many Ming literati that
the degree of belief in fate and examination success had gone too far. It
took a mortal such as Hu to recognize that the heavenly examiner was
poorly grounded in the linguistic foundations of the classical language that
most young boys had mastered in childhood.

Resistance to the mantic arts in examination life probably increased

during the Ch’ing, but given the deluge of candidates taking the civil
examinations after 1700 (see Chapter 4), it is unlikely that such resistance
had much effect in practice. Tai Ming-shih # % ttt (1653-1713), who
became a popular writer of classical essays and as an outside observer fre-
quently criticized the official examination rankings, ridiculed the popular
belief in the role of fate in these rankings. In his 1702 preface to his collec-
tion of the best provincial examination essays from that year, Tai pointed-
ly attacked those who attributed their success or failure to fate, ghosts, F
the mantic arts. In Tai’s view, the hard work required to learn how to
write proper eight-legged essays, outlined in Chapter 4, was the key fe
success or failure. In this regard, “individuals had to accept responsibility
because ghosts had no role to play” (A Ate > iii 5225 HEHE). Tai Ming

shih restored the years of childhood memorization and thousands of pe “
tice essays that had been elided in the rush to grant fate the final say- ;

for such an elite record of the role of, mantic. techniques and .dreams

This trend to reclassify and thereby redomesticate the oddities of the
civil examination experience shared much in Kind with the T’ang-Sung
evolution of the chih-kuai genre: overall, which“ had evolved in medieval
times into an acceptable elite record of unusual phenomena and human
fortune. The late Ming passion for dream interpretation never really
waned in the Ch’ing, but its official portrait became ‘more scholarly and
aloof, perhaps under the influence of a more sober-minded elite increas-
ingly oriented toward evidential research (see Chapter 9). Many Sung
literati, such as Ou-yang Hsiu, had ‘distanced themselves from the mantic
practices of their times, and many Ming-Ch’ing followers of the Ch’eng-
Chu orthodoxy or Han Learning followed their lead.!35
"By the late Ch’ing and early Republic, this: elite view of popular cus-
tom was reconfigured in modernist terms, a trend that culminated with
Hsu K’o’s ' Ch’ing-pai- lei-ch’ao Ye #4 98 BD" (Classified’ jottings on Ch’ing
dynasty unofficial history). In Hsu’s collection, examination lore was divid-
ed up and reclassified into the’ categories of “civil examinations,” “magi-
cians and shamans” (fang-chi Ji {%), and “confused beliefs” (mi-hsin 2 (2).
Hsu K’o intended his ‘collection ‘of lore, published in 1917, as.a sequel to
the Sung T’ai-p’ing ‘kuang-chi, but the new cultural context ensured that
such lore ‘was publicly ‘acceptable ‘among modernist literati only if it could
be pigeonholed as superstition.'®> Here we see that Ch’ing literati views of
mantic techniques: and the later “May Fourth” hostility toward imperial

Chinese “superstitions” were homologous.

Pu Sung-ling, a failure many times himself, immortalized the travails or
the vast majority trapped in the relentless machinery of late imperia cy
examinations in his many stories that parodied the examination system. ne

things. When entering the examination hall, bare-footed and carrying

who see their names on the list. P’u Sung-ling, however, tells us the emo-

renounces his studies, burns his books, and not satisfied with that, further
reveals the obsessive nature of his emotional reaction to failure by tram-
pling on the ashes of the physical traces of his years of sacrifice and hard
work and then. gathering them up to throw away as garbage. In the
accepted psychology of late imperial times, failure and religion go hand in
hand. Escape from the regime of examinations is culturally narrated by
Pu Sung-ling in light of Taoist and Buddhist notions of leaving this world
and entering the world of: pure. nature where human artifice does not
intervene. The candidate, who competed alone in the examination cell,
now seeks to live alone in the forest, away from friends and family.

summarizes: .

A young man going up to the capital to try his fortune orders supper at an
inn. While he is waiting for the millet to be cooked he falls asleep, his head
propped on a pillow given to him by another guest. He dreams that he
comes to the Capital, takes his degree, is promoted from one high post to
another, gets into trouble and is degraded, is recalled to office, endures the
hardship of distant campaigns, is accused of treason, condemned to death
saved at the last moment, and finally dies at a great old age. Awakening
from his dream he discovers that the millet-is not yet’ cooked. In a
~ moment’s ‘sleep ‘he has lived through the vicissitudes of a great public
career. Convinced that in'the world “honors are followed -by disgrace and
Praise by calumny” he turns back towards the village from which he came.
The pillow was a magic pillow, and the other guest a Taoist magician.’

Whether for failure or graduate, the therapeutic role ‘of religious awaken-
ing and dreams of an unencumbered life were available to both as an
escape from'the éxamination life and its subsequent careerist ordeals.
Though his parody of the anger felt by the examination failure is the
part of the narrative that most current readers -of P’u Sung-ling’s tale
focus on, the more important part comes at the end, for it was this part
that told examination candidates that they could cope with their failures.
P’u’s clinical depiction of the failure as an emotional wreck is not the final
story for him or for them. Rehabilitation, the return to mental peace of
mind and the restoration of personal confidence, is the final lesson. Here
P’u wisely tells us how and why the 99% who failed healed their mental
and physical wounds and in time returned to the examination cell to co™
pete again and again, not much wiser perhaps, but surely emotionally
stronger, more mature, and experienced in the ways of the examination
market and the difficult paths to fame and fortune in the late empire-

Accordingly, P’u Sung-ling’s realism is therapeutic in intent. Rebellion
and iconoclasm were among the responses that examination failures often
entertained, but in the end they persevered and became part of the vast
pool of residual manpower who repeatedly took examinations while they
got on with their lives. In P’u’s own case, this meant turning to writing
stories as an alternative means of cultural life and livelihood. Some could
channel their. frustrations into compiling examination editions for. local
printers or become local printers themselves, as did the Mas Rj and Tous
if in the Ssu-pao V4, Fu-chien, publishing. industries. Others would
crack under the pressure, as did the northern literatus Yen Yuan #30
(1635-1704), when he failed to cope with his personal family crisis and
with his continual_ failures on local examinations.. Yen successfully trans-
formed his emotional crisis into a virulent attack on Ch’eng-Chu teachings
as bookish and: the examinations as unmanly.'® Similarly, a Che-chiang
licentiate, when deprived of his local degree and expelled: by his father in
1819, was arrested by authorities in the Temple of. Confucius, where he
had damaged the tablet of Confucius while wailing and complaining.!
Pu Sung-ling’s therapeutic response, which falls far short of rebellion
against the civil examinations, was typical but not unique. Not infrequent-
ly, failures would take that extra emotional step and strike out at the
dynasty and its coercive examination regime.'® :

It has long been: taken for granted in accounts of late imperial history
that local troublemakers frequently came from the pool of local licentiates
who sought in vain to gain the coveted chiijen and chin-shih degrees.
Indeed, somé of the leaders of the northwest revolt, whose forces had cap-
hee Peking in'1644 and brought down the dynasty in north China, were
ocal examination -candidates who had repeatedly failed to gain high
office, Though the late Ming economic crisis, exacerbated by famine, cor-
om and war, was the primary cause for the weakness of the Ming

ter the Tung-lin: debacle (see Chapter 4), the willingness. of some dis-
sruntled examination candidates, such as Li Tzu-ch’eng 2% A Au (1605?—

Ppointment and anger among so many failures.’

Typically this series of fantastic visions that Hung: had in 1897

Hung Hsiu-ch’iian’s “madness”: or religious conversion. In‘ the forme
view, Hung was a victim of acute paranoia, “a form of psychosis in vihich
there are delusions of grandeur, hallucinations, and feelings of untoward
pride and hatred, all of which are. logically systematized so that the indi
vidual ‘actually believes -his disordered perceptions.” Following the latter
view, scholars contend that Hung -had been decisively influenced b
Christianity in his visits to Canton, and that these experiences “served as
a catalyst, transforming his disordered and frustrated : mind ‘through the
impact of the idea of: salvation and the. concept® of a ‘Man-God.’”
Alternatively, scholars in China have demystified Hung’s religious visions
and rationalized them as premonitions of a new political order in China
that would-replace the imperial system! 9s.

"The discussion of the mantic arts. and dreams in imperial Chinese

ernist, psychohistorical, | and sociohistorical » accounts.’ of: Hung Hsiv-
ch’tian’s initial dreams are. When placed within the historical context of
Chinese dream interpretation during the Ming and. Ch’ing dynasties,
Hung’s visions are less evidence of an individual: Han Chinese man’s
paranoia then they are comprehensible narratives drawing on the rich
symbolic traditions of Chinese religious and cultural. life, which well-
adjusted Ming chuang-yuan and Ch’ing literati equally engaged in and
which were deemed socially acceptable among upper elites until the late
seventeenth century. The cultural boundaries of ‘mental health were
drawn differently in late imperial China than in early modern Europe,

came a sign of his special future and confirmed his fate as the anointed
leader of the Taipings. Along with the rich repertoire of traditional
Chinese religious and mantic symbolism, ‘which included immortals, gods,
demons, and fairies, Hung initially had unconsciously added Christian
notions of a single old man in power in the heavens to the pluralist
menagerie of Taoist and Buddhist powers in the other world that inter-
yened in this world on behalf of young men who were trapped in the
examination life. As therapeutic as these visions were (Hung recovered on
his own without any successful medical treatment),: they -contained_omi-
nous elements that threatened to go beyond the usual limits of literati cri-
tiques and spoofs of the examiners and the civil examination system.

Rather than offering guarantees of examination success or even premo-
nitions that Hung would become an optimus, as Ming dreams formulaically
depicted, the old: man above had presented Hung Hsiu-ch’tian with impe-
rial regalia and a call to purify the world below. The Hung lineage called
in local doctors to treat the. illness and also asked a mantic expert to inter-
pret Hung’s visions:and exorcise the demon possessing him, but we have
no record of how the latter handled these disturbing aspects of the dream.
We know only that Hung rebuked the exorcist brought in to cure him. In
Ch’ing times, under Manchu rulers, the crime of lése-majesté was just
below the surface of Hung Hsiu-ch’iian’s manifest dreams.'7!

After recovering, Hung appeared more sure of himself, but his life was
relatively uneventful for several more years: Based on his dream, however,
Hung changed his name from Huo-hsiu to Hsiu-ch’iian, thinking, accord-

Christian doctrine “and in 1851 ordered civil examinations. under the
Heavenly Kingdom to commence.!”

By rejecting the: psychological mold that had in Nivison’s words con.
ventionalized literati protest against the civil examinations since the T’ang
dynasty, Hung’ Hsiu-ch’tian was revolutionary in the content of his
protest, but the institutional forms his examination protest took were still
conventional. After 1843, Hung’s “anomalous dream” was: used: by him
and his God Worshipers Society (Pai shang-ti.chiao = +42 to demon-
strate that Hung had ascended to heaven and met with God and Jesus
Christ. Their instructions to purify the earth meant that the Manchus had
to be removed, the Ch’ing dynasty overturned, and ° the teachings of
Confucius: and Mencius eliminated.. Hung had found his calling as the
new emperor of the Heavenly Kingdom of Eternal Peace (T’ai-p’ing Vien-
kuo K°-K B), which would establish an examination regime for young
men in the Yangtzu delta based on Sino-Christian Taiping truth. Whether
they admitted it or not, late Ch’ing reformers who decanonized the
official literati orthodoxy (see Chapter 11) used in the civil examinations

The popular, nonofficial dimensions of the civil examinations described in
this chapter affected the lives of elites and commoners in. remarkable
ways. Popular culture permeated the examination venues of the dynasty,
while Hanlin examiners vainly struggled to keep the mantic arts out of the
examination compound. Although such attempts failed, their efforts suc
ceeded in setting limits to the scope of religion and popular culture in the
orthodox content of the civil examination papers until the eruption °
Taiping religiosity and its penetration of examinations in the 1850S (see
Chapter 11). "The next chapter further examines elite aspects of the cultur-

CHAPTER SEVEN

The Cultural Scope
of Civil Examinations and |
the Eight-Legged Essay among Elites

The public ceremonies that accompanied the testing and sélection of can-
didates for public office accorded local sheng-yuan, provincial chiijen, and
palace chin-shih graduates with both sociopolitical status and cultural pres-
tige. Classical literacy, the mastery of Tao-hsueh learning, and the ability to
write terse but elegant examination essays together publicly marked the
educated literati whose names appeared on the final lists of graduates. In
addition to its political and social functions (described in previous chap-
ters), the civil service competition successfully created a dynastic curricu-
lum that consolidated gentry, military, and merchant families empirewide
into a culturally defined status group of degree-holders sharing a common
classical language and memorization of a mutual canon of Classics.

The internalization of a literary culture that was in part defined by the
civil examination curriculum also influenced the literatus’ public and pri-
vate definition of his moral.character and social ‘conscience.’ A view of
8°vernment, society, and the individual’s role as an elite servant of the

yNasty was continually reinforced in the memorization process leading up
‘0 the examinations themselves. The moral cultivation of the literatus
(shit-hsi £3; see Tables ‘8.5 and 8.6) was a perennial concern of the
‘MPerial court as it sought to ensure that the officials it chose in the exam-
‘nation market would serve the people in the name of the ruling family.
