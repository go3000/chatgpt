PU SONGLING AND THE QING EXAMINATION SYSTEM

Allan Barr”

Admirers of Liaozhai zhiyi, the collection of strange tales by Pu Song-
ling (1640-1715), have long considered the author’s failure to fulfill his
career aspirations as a critical factor inspiring the composition of the work
and influencing the form which it took. As early as 1723, the painter and
poet Gao Genghan (1683-1751) commented in a postface to the anthol-
ogy, "At an early age Liaozhai displayed brilliant talent but, unfavored in
the examinations, he received: no recognition, and to express the stifled
feelings that filled his heart, he had no other recourse but to write this
book."! These remarks have often been echoed by later critics as they
relate Pu’s experiences in the examination hall to his preoccupations in
Liaozhai.

The present study attempts to provide an answer to a question that is
central to our understanding of Pu Songling’s examination life: why did
he fail? It is a question on which scholarly opinion is divided: the
Japanese historian Miyazaki Ichisada has concluded that, given the institu-
tional factors governing the examinations results, it was hardly surprising
that Pu never passed,2 whereas two recent biographical studies by Maeno
Naoaki and Gao Mingge suggest that choices or blunders made by Pu
Songling himself largely shaped the course of his career.? Of these two

conflicting views, Miyazaki’s is much the more persuasive, but his case
can be documented in greater detail if we focus our attention on the con-
ditions prevailing in Pu Songling’s own time. The first half of this article
thus sets out to identify the chief external factors that affected Pu
Songling’s candidacy in the late seventeenth-century provincial examina-
tion.

The second concern of this study is to reassess Pu’s response to the
examination system, as reflected in Liaozhai. Ever since Yang Liu
classified “satire and attack on the examination system" as one of the four
major elements in the “ideological content" of Liaozhai,* the characteriza-
tion of Pu Songling as a fierce critic of the examination system has
become a commonplace of academic discourse both in China and in the
West. As later discussion will show, a careful reading of Liaozhai leads
one to conclude that Pu’s dissatisfaction with the system was accom-
panied, or even overshadowed, by a deep sense of the omnipotence of
fate, and that any evaluation of Pu as a commentator on the examinations
must be modified accordingly.

Pu Songling as Examination Candidate

An outline of Pu Songling’s examination record will be a valuable pre-
liminary to further consideration of these issues. As a boy, Songling was
gifted with a retentive memory and a lively intelligence, and was regarded
by his father, a man of scholarly leanings but modest social and economic
status, as the most promising of his four sons.© This judgement was vindi-
cated when in 1658 the eighteen year old student passed top of the list in
the district examination. Pu went on to collect the highest position in the
prefectural examination and repeated the feat in the qualifying examina-
tion (yuan shi). His essays were singled out for praise by the education
intendant,’ the prominent poet Shi Runzhang (1619-1683). This warm

endorsement by a famous man of letters established for the young scholar
an enviable reputation among his fellow government students in Jinan
prefecture.® At this point in his life, all the signs seemed to indicate that
he might well become one of the most outstanding Shandong scholars of
his generation.

Of his ensuing attempts to pass the provincial examination we have
only an incomplete record. After such a brilliant start to his career, Pu
would no doubt have been keen to extend his run of success in the first
provincial examination for which he was qualified, that of 1660. But when
the list of graduates was issued, Pu’s name was conspicuously absent, an
omission soon to become recurrent. Although we cannot be sure how reg-
ularly Pu entered for subsequent examinations, given his relative youth in
the 1660s and 1670s it is unlikely he would have willingly dropped out of
competition.

A poem dated 1678 reveals that Pu, then thirty-eight, had made another
abortive attempt to pass in that year.? The demoralization that followed in
its wake no doubt contributed to the unrelieved gloom to which he gave
expression in the preface to his stories composed in the following spring.
His fortieth birthday, as several of his poems show,!9 was a painful re-
minder of how little he had achieved in the first half of his life.

We know that Pu Songling competed in the provincial examination of
1687, but here he made the unfortunate mistake of skipping a page in his
answer book when writing out one of his essays and was automatically
failed for breach of regulations.!! Pu’s next attempt in 1690 was also
unsuccessful,!2 and Lu Dahuang and others have inferred that it was his
last.!3 Their conclusion is based on a passage in the biographical sketch of
his wife which Pu wrote soon after her death in 1713. In it he says:

In my fifties I had still not abandoned hope of advancement. She urged

ated, was a favorite of Pu’s, and he used it to denote the rejection of true talent in the exami-
nations. See Liaozhai 1:84; and the lyric "To Wang Rushui," Pu Songling ji 1:702.

me to desist, saying, "You’re going to have to give this up! If you had
been destined to be eminent, you would be a government minister by
now. One can find happiness here among the hills and woods--why
need you look for entertainment in the music of bamboo striking flesh!"
I thought this good advice. But when my sons and grandson went to
take the provincial examination, absorbed by my narrow ambition I
could not help but feel a certain hope, and words often betrayed my
feelings, but she ignored them completely. Sometimes I would try to
win her over by observing portents of success, but these too she disre-
garded. I laughed and said, "My dear, do you want to be a lady?" Her
answer was: "I have no other virtues, but I do know where to stop."!4

Lu Dahuang takes this to mean that Pu did not enter himself as a candi-
date after 1690, an interpretation that finds some support in the comment
by Pu Ruo that his father "lost heart for the examinations" in his fifties.!5
Both statements, however, fall short of outright declarations that Pu com-
pletely withdrew from competition, and their reliability is open to ques-
tion.

Some of Pu Songling’s surviving examination answers do in fact furnish
evidence of continued participation after 1690. The latest of Pu’s
memorials, compositions required of all candidates in the provincial
examination, dates from 1705, while others were written in every exami-
nation year from 1693 to 1702.!7 The regular production of such pieces
suggests that Pu was still actively engaged in examination preparation dur-
ing these years.

To sum up, then, Pu Songling’s trials in the provincial examination hall
appear to have spanned almost fifty years. Although he may have missed
the occasional session due to illness or poor results in the preliminary test
(ke shi), until 1705 graduation at the provincial level remained a prime
objective in life. Pu thereafter seems to have abandoned his efforts as
futile.

18 Although Pu visited Jinan again in 1708, he seems to have been a spectator rather than a
participant in the examinations of the year. See his "Song of Lixia," Pu Songling ji 1:618-19.
It should be noted that as a government student Pu was still required to attend the triennial
sui examination which determined the promotion and demotion of students. In 1682 he had
been awarded the rank of stipend student on the basis of high marks in this examination (Pu
Songling ji 2:1770). It was not until 1711 that he was promoted to tribute student (see Ma
Zhenfang, “Pu Songling xinmao suigong kao" (Verification of Pu Songling’s 1711 tribute stu-
dentship), Wen shi 15 (Sept. 1982):291-93).

Pu Songling and the Qing Examination System 91

Given Pu Songling’s extraordinary abilities, recognized by his examiner
in 1658 as well as by many contemporary scholars and later readers, his
failure to pass at the second level has aroused much speculation, and a
number of explanations for it have been offered. Recent studies in both
China and Japan have tended to place particular emphasis on factors
relating directly to Pu Songling the individual which may have put him at
a disadvantage in competition with other candidates. Maeno Naoaki and
Gao Mingge suggest that Pu was reluctant to apply himself single-
mindedly to study, and they identify a poetry club which Pu and his
friends founded in 1659 as an early instance of his susceptibility to dis-
traction from a competitive career.!9 Maeno notes that in the 1660s Pu
amused himself by composing lyrics for popular Shandong folk tunes, and
points out that Pu’s short stories, which he may have begun writing as
early as the 1660s, constituted another conflicting investment of time and
effort.20 Both Maeno and Gao therefore draw a parallel between Pu Song-
ling and Wei Haogu, the young poetry enthusiast reprimanded so sternly
for his unorthodox interests by his examiner Zhou Jin in a famous scene
from the eighteenth-century novel Rulin waishi.2! Like Wei, they argue,
Pu damaged his prospects by indulging in extra-curricular pastimes. Pu
Songling, as Gao Mingge puts it, "took the wrong road right from the
start": his individualistic inclinations made his failure almost a foregone
conclusion.22 .

In my view, however, we will reach a truer understanding of why Pu
never passed if we divert attention away from him and consider instead
the institutional features which determined the selection of provincial gra-
duates in the early Qing period. Overwhelming evidence indicates that it
was these objective conditions rather than subjective factors relating solely
to Pu Songling which really moulded the pattern of his undistinguished
Career.

The Examination Institution in Seventeenth-Century Shandong

It is common knowledge that the examination system was extremely
competitive. It is important to note, however, that during the years when
Pu Songling participated competition was particularly intense. This
becomes clear if we examine the academic record, not of Pu Songling, but
of the district in which he resided, Zichuan. Seventeenth-century Zichuan
was a county proud of its scholarly traditions. Though by no means a
rich area, Zichuan could boast a record of scholastic achievement that
compared favorably with other districts in Jinan prefecture. In the late
Ming period (1573-1643) twenty-two local scholars achieved the distinc-
tion of becoming metropolitan graduates,?3 including several men who
went on to become high officials.24 Pu Songling’s own lineage also pros-
pered during this time, producing two district magistrates and one provin-
cial graduate.25

In the opening years of the Qing dynasty, Zichuan maintained its excel-
lent record in the examinations. During the Shunzhi period (1644-1661),
seven provincial examinations were held in which no less than thirty-nine
local scholars were awarded the provincial degree, an average of about six
per examination. These included two relatives of Pu Songling, Pu Rui
and Pu Zhenying, who passed in 1651 and 1657 respectively.26

Subsequently, the success rate plummeted. During the sixty-year reign
of the Kangxi emperor (1662-1772), twenty-one provincial examinations
were held, in which only twenty-seven Zichuan scholars passed, an aver-
age of little more than one graduate per examination.2” Why this dramatic
drop in the pass rate? The explanation is not hard to find. In the years
immediately following the subjugation of China, the Qing administration,
anxious not to antagonize the key intellectual class whose support it
sought, offered aspiring scholars opportunities for upward mobility which
equalled or bettered those existing in the late Ming period. Thus the
quota for provincial graduates in the first Shandong examination in 1645
was fixed at ninety, a figure slightly in excess of that which prevailed in
the early seventeenth century. When Pu Songling’s cousin received his

(jinshi 1601), who held the post of minister of rites. See Zichuan xianzhi 6.26b-30b.

25 Pu’s great-uncle Shengwen (jinshi 1592) served as magistrate of Yutian (Zichuan xianzhi
5.5a). Shengwen’s cousin Shengchi, a tribute student, took office in Wuji in 1584 (Zichuan
xianzhi $.23b, Chongxiu Wuji xianzhi [1936] 6.14b). Shengchi’s grandson Zhaochang
passed the provincial examination of 1621 (Zichuan xianzhi 5.15a).

degree in 1651 the quota had been enlarged even further: he and his
ninety-seven fellow graduates formed the largest class ever in Shandong’s
history.28

Inflated admissions quotas, which were in effect at each of the three
stages of the examinations during this period, imposed heavy strains on
the institutional structure, however, and by the final years of the Shunzhi
period the authorities felt confident enough to slash the entrance quotas at
all levels. In 1660, by coincidence the very same year that Pu Songling
launched his campaign to secure a provincial degree, the quota for Shan-
dong was halved, to forty-six.2? Although later in the Kangxi reign the
quota was raised somewhat, throughout the bulk of Pu’s career the grad-
uating class in each triennial session was smaller than it had been for over
a century.

During the Kangxi era, the provincial examination was intensely com-
petitive not only in terms of the constricted graduation quota but also in
terms of the volume of candidates competing for those limited places.
Though in 1645 it had been decreed that only thirty candidates could
enter for every one place in the quota,29 this edict was generally not
enforced, partly because officials found that an indulgent policy in admit-
ting candidates to the examination hall was a good way of courting popu-
larity with provincial scholars.3! The ratio of candidates to places com-
monly ranged from about 80:1 to 100:1. In a typical example, the Henan
examination of 1681, for the forty-seven places in the pass quota, more
than 4,500 candidates competed.32 It was not until the 1740s that efforts

examination of the same year, over 4,000 candidates competed for 47 places (Li Zhenyu,
Baishi shanfang ji (Collected Works of Li Zhenyu) (Kangxi. edn.) 14.1b-2a). Prior to the
reduction of the quota, a more favorable ratio had existed. In the Henan examination of
1654, for example, over 4,000 candidates competed for 99 places (Sun Zhongyi, Airitang

were made by the Qianlong emperor to regulate strictly the admission of
candidates to the examination.>3 In Pu Songling’s time, a liberal policy
produced extreme congestion at the provincial level.

A number of other defects in the administration of the provincial exam-
inations existed in the early Qing and often operated to the disadvantage
of the most gifted candidates. The first two Qing emperors paid relatively
little attention to the administrative details of the examinations, and it was
not until the Yongzheng emperor came to power in 1723 that a flurry of
edicts were issued, designed to correct some of the more glaring
anomalies.>4

The first problem concerned the competence of the examiners. The
team responsible for reading and grading the papers was led by a provin-
cial examiner and an assistant provincial examiner appointed by the cen-
tral government. These two men read only a small proportion of the
papers, usually just those recommended to them by their subordinates.35
In practice, therefore, their power to control the selection process was cir-
cumscribed. The main responsibility for distinguishing the good papers
from the bad was delegated to a dozen or so examination aides selected by
the provincial administration in Shandong, consisting of department and
district magistrates temporarily transferred from their normal duties.
Although these men had entered official life on the basis of their success
in the examination hall, many people doubted whether they were the most
appropriate judges of scholarship. As the Yongzheng emperor observed in
an edict of 1727, "After a magistrate takes up office, he is daily embroiled
in official documents and matters pertaining to tax collection, and his
knowledge of the principles of literary composition will inevitably become
rusty."5 Provincial governors were reluctant to lose the services of their

33 Shili, 337.8ab.
¥ Edicts relating to examination matters occupy only pages 1a-3b of juan 5 of Shizu sheng-
xun (Sacred Edicts of the Shunzhi Emperor) (in Shi chao shengxun (Sacred Edicts of Ten
Emperors), late-Qing edn.), and only pages la-11la of juan 12 of Shengzu shengxun (Kangxi).
In contrast, edicts on the same subject in Shizong shengxun (Yongzheng) occupy pages la-
16a of juan 10, and in Gaozong shengxun (Qianlong) they extend from juan 33 to juan 40.
35 For a summary of the examining process, see Miyazaki, p. 52. Shi Runzhang indicates
that the provincial examiner would read just a tiny percent of papers, a number perhaps half
as large again as the quota for the province (Xueyutang waniji 2.1 1a).
36 Shili, 334.4b. A century earlier, Ai Nanying (1583-1646) had complained, “The examina-
tion aides are ali just temporarily seconded from their handling of official documents and le-
gal cases, and cannot be compared to the education intendant, who devotes his concentration
and energy to the reading of papers and whose mission is to evaluate literary merit." See Ai
Nanying, Tian yongzi ji (Collected Works of Ai Nanying) (1879 repr.) 2.6b. In a seldom no-
ticed passage in Rulin waishi, Wu Jingzi also contrasts the accurate evaluations at the first
level with the inept selections at the second. In chapter 49, the vain and mediocre Hanlin
Academician Gao remarks that although he had often been given low grades by the educa-
tion intendant, he succeeded in passing the provincial examination. See Rulin waishi (Bei-
jing: Zuojia chubanshe, 1955), pp. 480-81.

most able and conscientious administrators for the 4-6 week period neces-
sary to fulfill the duties of an examiner. They therefore tended not to
select those magistrates who would make the most effective examiners, but
simply those whose absence from office would be of least consequence.
As the Qianlong emperor noted in 1756, "Governors-general and gover-
nors .. . usually choose those whose area of jurisdiction is not very impor-
tant and whose performance in office is average. In some cases they even
appoint men whose powers are already near decline and whose energies
are limited."37

Both of the Kangxi emperor’s immediate successors devised various
means to improve and regulate the quality of examiners, either giving
prospective aides a written test to check their competence or employing
instead scholars who were not burdened with administrative commit-
ments.38 But during the period when Pu Songling was a candidate, the
system whereby government bureaucrats were indiscriminately assigned to
examination duty was still in force. As preliminary decisions to pass or
fail were made by the examination aides, this constituted a serious flaw in
the selection process.

The sheer volume of examination papers to read and evaluate presented
these often rather second-rate examiners with almost insurmountable
difficulties. They received scripts submitted in the first session on the
eleventh day of the eighth month, and were required to announce the list
of successful candidates by the first of the ninth month at the very latest.39
It was only after Pu Songling’s retirement from competition that the dead-
line was extended to allow examiners more time for the thorough inspec-
tion of papers.4° In Pu’s day, then, examiners were expected within the
space of about a fortnight to plough through the mountains of scripts
presented in all three sessions of the examination by several thousand can-
didates.

The problems confronting the graders are well summarized by an
eighteenth-century provincial examiner:

To evaluate people on the basis of their words has since ancient times
been considered difficult. To try and assess a man’s learning accumu-
lated through a lifetime by the essays of a day is all the more forbidding
a task. Over 4,000 scholars take part in the Hunan examination, gen-
erating over 12,000 sets of scripts for the three sessions. If you count
the aggregate of essays, discussions, dissertations and poems, this
amounts to nothing less than 56,000 compositions. My colleagues and
I have spent eighteen days and nights since we started reading papers
until the final selection. The volume of scripts was enormous and time
was limited. If one were to assert that our decisions were in all cases
appropriate and that not one talented scholar was overlooked, I could
not honestly place too much faith in this claim.4!

It was humanly impossible to give adequate attention to all the papers
in the time allowed. The combination of pressure of time and volume of
work had two effects on the selection process. The first was that dispro-
portionate emphasis was given to the first session of the examination,
which consisted exclusively of the so-called "eight-leg" essays.42 Form
dominated content in these essays, and candidates were required to con-
form to rigidly conceived principles of composition. The result was, as
one official put it, "the accomplished essay does not differ to any great
degree from the inferior work, and selection and rejection lack any
dependable basis for judgment."43 The second and third sessions, which
set questions of greater substance, including discussions of historical or
political topics and issues in contemporary affairs, played only a minor
role in determining the final results. If a candidate’s essays in the first ses-
sion failed to impress the examiner, it was unlikely that outstanding
papers in the subsequent sessions would alter the examiner’s negative

opinion. Although the examination was designed to be quite comprehen-
sive and potentially could test quite a wide range of intellectual and
literary aptitudes, in practice decisions hinged on the examiner’s subjective
appraisal of the "eight-leg" essays alone.

The second consequence was that hasty and sloppy grading was inevit-
able. Essays were unpunctuated, and in their hurry or in a lapse of con-
centration, examiners might mispunctuate a difficult passage and lose the
sense, or skim through papers carelessly without pausing to consider the
quality of the work.4

Another factor tended to inhibit the selection of outstanding scholars.
After each examination, the papers of successful candidates were
dispatched to the Ministry of Rites in Beijing for a further round of check-
ing for errors, violations of prescribed form, or infractions of convention.
Examiners faced disciplinary action if the papers they passed were
regarded as defective by the central authorities. This led them to adopt a
safety-first policy in grading, opting for predictable and stereotyped essays
which they were confident would not provoke criticism. Essays which
posed certain difficulties in comprehension or interpretation would be
passed over in favor of pieces which, though ordinary, were formally
unobjectionable. A number of observers blamed this tendency for the
phenomenon of second-rate scholars being selected instead of truly
talented men.*5

In this connection it is interesting to note that the qualifying examina-
tion at which Pu Songling was awarded his first degree had been admin-
istered by an official particularly sensitive to this kind of problem. Shi
Runzhang was critical of colleagues who showed an undue preference for
shallow compositions and was well-known for his adventurous examining
policy. He quoted a Ming writer to the effect that "words must flow from
the heart," and added, "Meaningless essays which have borrowed their
ideas right and left do not deserve to be selected," summing up his guiding
principle in the declaration, "It would be better to pick a blemished jade
than a flawless pebble."*6 It may have been no coincidence that Pu Song-
ling passed with distinction when this enterprising selection policy was

enforced.

Two other anomalies further impeded the rational selection of the best
candidates. The number of papers assigned to each reader for grading
often differed substantially. Individual examination aides were made
responsible for marking the scripts of candidates specializing in particular
titles of the five classics, and as some of the classics attracted more candi-
dates than others, some graders might have to read as many as a thousand
papers, while others were let off lightly, with just a couple of hundred. It
was not until 1777 that a more equitable distribution of the work-load was
approved.47 Until that time, these discrepancies placed excessive burdens
on some examiners and adversely affected the quality of their grading.

Secondly, in determining the final selection the provincial examiner was
required to observe set quotas for the papers graded by each examination
aide. If one reader had recommended many excellent papers and another
had recommended a less distinguished group of scripts, the provincial exa-
miner would be compelled ruthlessly to prune the first total and possibly

_ pass papers of lesser merit from the second, in order to satisfy these rigid
quotas. Again, it was not until the 1720s that a more flexible policy was
adopted which allowed the provincial examiner to disregard such con-
siderations and use quality as the sole criterion for selection.48

Finally, we should note that there existed a real danger that some
papers would not even be read, let alone marked. Once an examiner had
filled his slim quota of selected papers, he had no great incentive except
the stirrings of his own conscience to plough on through the remainder of
his pile.49 In an attempt to prevent negligence, an edict of 1679 required
that failed papers be returned to candidates with some indication of why
they were considered unsatisfactory.°9 It is doubtful whether this elim-
inated the problem, for examiners could simply justify the rejection of a
paper with a vague criticism like "lacking in distinction" or "not excep-
tional," which could apply to almost any piece of work, and which could
quickly be scrawled at the top of any paper.>!

Corruption was another factor affecting Pu Songling’s prospects. Collu-
sion between candidates and examiners in the early Qing seriously under-
mined the ideal of a selection process based on the impartial evaluation of
academic achievement. Given the high attrition rate in the provincial

examinations, it was particularly tempting to resort to corrupt practices to
assure success at this level. The examinations held in Zhili and Jiangnan
gained especial notoriety during this period, as a series of scandals made it:
clear that some examiners were accepting bribes and awarding degrees to
the sons of high officials. In Zhili in 1657, for example, one examination
aide promised to pull strings for as many as twenty-five candidates, and
several of his colleagues made similar arrangements. The scandal broke
after the results were published, and five aides were executed.°? After the
discovery of similar violations in the Jiangnan examination of the same
year, fourteen graduates were disqualified and all the examiners were put
to death.>3 Despite these stern punishments, irregularities continued to be
uncovered at intervals throughout the Kangxi reign. Frustrated candi-
dates, outraged by the blatant favoritism sometimes shown, staged protest
demonstrations on a number of occasions and invented jingles which ridi-
culed the shameless behavior of their judges.>4

Unscrupulous acts of collusion between examiners and the minority of
candidates who possessed ample funds or influential connections naturally
worked to the disadvantage of scholars like Pu Songling who could not
compete on these terms with the rich and privileged. The dispropor-
tionate examination success of the sons of well-placed families in the late
seventeenth century finally forced the government to adopt measures to
appease hostile public opinion. So-called "official quotas" were established
in 1700 which set a strict limit on the proportion of graduates who could
come from a high official background. Thereafter, in the Shandong exam-
ination only one place in ten was reserved for scholars related to high
office-holders, and the other places were awarded to men of lower family
status.°> One may safely assume that prior to 1700 the proportion of sons
of officials in each graduating class was much higher.

In conclusion, it seems both misguided and unnecessary to seek the rea-
sons for Pu Songling’s examination failures in the writer’s personal
idiosyncrasies. What really impeded his progress were the constricted gra-
duation quotas during his lifetime and the vagaries of the selection pro-
cess. Pu Songling’s case is therefore far from unique: among his genera-
tion of Shandong intellectuals we find many other gifted men who
suffered similar frustrations. Pu’s friend Zhang Duqing (1642-1711+) was

an unsuccessful candidate in eleven provincial examinations between 1663
and 1705.56 Pu’s relative by marriage Yuan Ruyu (1643-1726), who had
become a government student when just thirteen, failed in the provincial
examination on seven occasions.°7 Li Yochen (1643-1722+), another
friend, was only fifteen when he was awarded the first degree, but a life-
time of competition at the higher level achieved nothing.*® The Zichuan
scholar Zhang Yongji (1652-1735) was recognized at an early age as a
man of outstanding abilities, but did not receive the provincial degree
until he was fifty-nine.°? Pu’s friend Bi Shengyu (1651-1723+) won top
place in the district, prefectural and qualifying examinations but partici-
pated (unsuccessfully at the provincial level on no less than sixteen occa-
sions.

The extremely low pass rate and the irrational features of the selection
process aroused the in participants the sense that the whole system was
one gigantic lottery in which they themselves could do little to improve
their chances, and where they were totally at the mercy of a higher force
whose operations appeared random and unpredictable. This sense of
helplessness was not peculiar to early Qing candidates, though it seems to
have been particularly common among them. As early as 1043, the Song
official Fan Zhongyan (989-1052) had noted, “Selection or rejection of a
candidate is often attributed to fate and not to achievement,"©! and a
number of Ming writers had expressed a similar skepticism, including Gui
Youguang (1506-1571), who remarked: “In the examination hall it is just
a matter of luck--there is no other special technique you can learn to
assure success."°2 A popular saying circulated in Pu Songling’s day: “In
the examinations one cannot discuss literary merit,"63 reflecting this same

belief that success and failure were a matter of accident or fate.

This denial of any clear connection between the examination results
and the-intellectual caliber of the candidates was further elaborated in the
belief that the examination system essentially functioned as an instrument
of divine retribution. A rich anecdotal literature developed over the cen-
turies which related success and failure to one’s own moral behavior, in
this life or a previous one, or to the conduct of one’s ancestors. Again,
this strain of thought can be traced back at least to the Song period. A
twelfth-century anecdote concerns a candidate who seduces a young
woman immediately after the second session of the examinations. That
night his parents have an identical dream in which a messenger from
heaven announces that their son has passed at the top of the list. No
sooner does he say this than another officer corrects him: “That is not
right. He has committed an improper act, and Heaven has suspended
him for one examination." Sure enough, a few days later the young man
is duly failed for a breach of regulations.®4 Stories of this type were col-
lected assiduously by Qing writers, and whole anthologies were devoted to
them.

The belief that suprahuman forces determine examination selection was
not confined to frustrated students attempting to rationalize their failures.
One of the most forceful assertions that fate governs the outcome was
made by the scholar Xu Fang (1619-1665+), who passed the Jiangxi pro-
vincial examination in 1639. He learned subsequently that his papers ori-
ginally had been set aside unmarked, as the examination aide had already
selected a sufficient number to recommend to the provincial examiner.
Miraculously, his untouched scripts found their way into the pile of
recommended papers and caught the examiner’s eye, thereby enabling Xu
Fang to graduate near the top of the list. Reflecting upon this episode
years later, he attributed his good fortune entirely to the support of

anecdotes in The Thorny Gates of Learning in Sung China: A Social History of the Exami-
nations (Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 169-81. Episodes analogous to Hong Mai’s
tale are found in Liaozhai 3.424 and 4.514-15. C. K. Yang discusses the appeal to candi-

heavenly powers, rewarding him for the merits accumulated by his family.
In Xu’s view, the gaping disparity between the pass quota and the
immense pool of excellent candidates rendered the selection process virtu-
ally meaningless. He added:

A candidate on a particular day may do better or worse than at other
times, while the examiner is even more prone to some sudden predilec-
tion or aversion to his work. There is thus no guarantee that the most
gifted will be selected, nor that those selected will be the most gifted. In
short, if luck comes your way, then you will succeed; if luck is against
you, you will not. To pass is fortuitous, to fail is commonplace.®

Other explanations for examination success he firmly repudiated. The
ultimate vanity, he argued, was for graduates to claim that it was their
talent which earned them their degrees.

Typically, frustrated candidates moved to a more resigned stance over
time, as youthful confidence in their ability to shape their own future was
gradually eroded by bitter experience, and in later life they were
overwhelmed by a sense of utter waste. This process of disillusionment is
clearly charted in the autobiography of An Zhiyuan (1628-1701), a Shan-
dong writer who sat the provincial examination for fifteen consecutive
occasions between 1645 and 1684, failing every time. At his seventieth
birthday, looking back on his futile career, he described two of his three
greatest regrets as follows:

Promptly at the age of seventeen I went off to take part in the “battle
of letters," but was retired fifteen times. I travelled north to Yantai
(Beijing) and journeyed west to Lixia (Jinan), shivering in my student’s
gown and swaying on my weary donkey. In my worst moments I was
pelted simultaneously by sand and hail in the hinterland of Ying and
Mo (in 1660 I had gone as far as the outlying areas of Mo when I met
with hailstones as big as hens’ eggs--a dangerous situation); I was con-
fronted jointly by arrows and knives in the outskirts of Yuling (in 1654
I had reached Yuling when I was robbed by mounted bandits and lost
my travelling expenses). In my envy of some paltry glory I never
turned back in the face of such perils. When I recalled the ancient say-
ing, "Failure and success are governed by fate," I felt as though I had
awakened from a dream or recovered from a drunken stupor, but (by

this time) my creative energies had been squandered on examination
essays for over forty years. I can only grieve that in the twilight of my
life I cannot halt the passage of time. This is a second regret.

I remember that in the spring of 1666 the provincial graduate Gao
Genzhong and I were ascending Taishan, and when we reached Yellow
Scarp Ridge, we met a white-haired Taoist skilled in physiognomy. He
scrutinized my face and said, "You are not destined to be eminent in
the realm of dust. Come and meet me here beneath the tall pine tree in
ten years’ time, and I will speak with you of things outside this world."
At the time I was brimming over with self-confidence and believed that
wealth and status would surely be mine. Inwardly resenting his
remarks, I made no response to his offer. It is now over twenty years
since that day, and I am feeble and fatigued, content to be an outdated
relic. I sigh that "rock marrow" is hard to find; I lament that the Taoist
immortal has gone I know not where. This is the third thing I regret.’

Examination Candidates in Liaozhai

It is against this background that we should consider the response to the
examinations which is reflected in Pu Songling’s work. The central male
characters in almost all of his short stories are like himself scholars of rela-
tively low status: either government students or Confucian apprentices. It
is the preoccupation with this social group which gives the sprawling col-
lection a unity it might otherwise lack. The tales focus on diverse aspects
of the scholars’ lives: some describe their romantic entanglements or mar-
ital difficulties, some their humiliations at the hands of gentry or
officialdom, others their encounters with ghosts, demons and immortals.
But throughout the book, the examination treadmill looms ominously in
the background, casting its shadows on the scholars’ lives as failure con-
stantly gnaws away at their self-respect and generates tensions in their per-
sonal relationships.

The selection process generally is presented in Pu’s fiction as irrational
and totally unpredictable. Time and again, the essays of a talented scho-
lar are recognized by everyone as work of the highest quality, but he does
not receive the deserved honours in the examination hall.®8

marrow" (Su Shi, Dongpo zhilin (Dongpo’s Forest of Notes) (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1981)

In a number of tales Pu Songling exposes the institutional flaws in the
examination system. At times success is attributed to influential contracts
or simple bribery.©9 More often, however, the irresponsibility and incom-
petence of the examiners are identified as the most serious defects in the
system. Examiners are implicitly criticized for entrusting the grading of
papers to subordinates unsuited to the task, or for not maintaining ade-
quate surveillance of the selection process.7°

Like other critics, Pu seems to have felt that examiners at the provincial
level were generally less discriminating than those who awarded the first
degree. In one tale, a brilliant scholar who repeatedly fails the provincial
examination is told by a friend, “Your essays are more than good enough
to secure you top place in the lower examination, but they will not win
you a place even at the bottom of the graduation list in the provincial
examination."’! It is only when the scholar abandons his high standards
and models his style on the most stereotyped kind of essay that he
impresses his examiners and passes.

In "Yu Qu’e," Pu Songling raises the issue which was later to concern
the Yongzheng emperor: whether ordinary magistrates are really qualified
to act as readers in the provincial examination. In this, his most elaborate
satire of the examination system, Pu invents an underworld system of
examinations whose operations furnish an enlightening contrast, or some-
times a mocking parallel, to the conventional human administration. In
the underworld, so as to maintain high standards of accuracy in grading,
prospective examiners must themselves undergo a rigorous screening pro-
cess. Only those officials who have demonstrated their proficiency in a
written test are permitted be become examiners, and all others are
disqualified. A character in the story notes pointedly that in the human
world, on the other hand, the magistrates who are commonly appointed as
readers are not subjected to scrutiny, and the principle of selection on
merit is consequently jeopardized.

Although in normal circumstances Pu Songling’s imaginary underworld
examination would far surpass its earthly counterpart as a reliable testing
system, in this particular year the preliminary selection of examiners is
cancelled, and examiners are appointed instead in the same haphazard
manner which prevails among the living. The chosen list of readers, which
includes a blind ghost and the spirit of an avaricious money-grabber, is

therefore an effective commentary on corresponding human mismanage-
ment. As one might expect, the results of an examination entrusted to
such a motley crew are a complete travesty, and a superbly qualified ghost
is failed. Later the examiners’ decisions are scrutinized and two-thirds of
the graduates are deemed unsatisfactory and stripped of their degrees.72
Once again the implications for the earthly examinations are clear: there
is little chance that the strongest candidates will be selected unless the
most able examiners are recruited.

Were Pu Songling to maintain consistently that the anomalies in the
selection process derived primarily from the ineptitude of the examiners,
this would constitute a damaging indictment of the examination system,
and Liaozhai scholars, by stressing the critical tone of Pu’s comments,
have often claimed that such an expose indeed composes one of the three
or four main themes of Pu’s work.?73 This conclusion, however, is based
on a highly selective reading of Liaozhai which ignores another crucial
element in Pu’s presentation of the selection process, an element that bal-
ances or even outweighs the human factor: fate. This is seen as an
irresistible force which no amount of literary talent can counteract, and a
resigned acceptance of its influence on the results is urged upon frustrated ©
candidates. Pu’s criticisms of the administration of the examinations
therefore tend to lose their potency, as human selection procedures fade
into insignificance in face of Heaven, the supreme examiner.

In a typical case, Student Ye’s failures in the provincial examination are
attributed to a divine agency that governs his career: “Unknown to him,
destiny confines men, ’art loathes fate’, and when the results were
announced, he suffered rejection once again." After literally dying of heart-
break, Ye, now a ghost, comes to terms with his setbacks. When his
patron tests his reaction to repeated failure, he responds, "It was probably
destined to be so.". The author’s postscript adopts the same tone of philo-
sophical resignation: "Living in this world, all a man can do is close his
eyes and march forward, submitting to whatever destiny, lofty or low,
Heaven may allocate. There is no shortage of men like Ye in the world,
who possess remarkable abilities yet drown in disappointment."/4

A story entitled "The Commissioner of Literary Affairs" provides the
most extensive exegesis of the relationship between fate and examination
results. The tale introduces four characters: an able scholar named
Wang; his friend, a ghost named Song; a third-rate scholar; and a blind
monk. The monk predicts that the good scholar will pass and the third-
rate scholar fail, but in fact the reverse happens: Wang fails and the
mediocrity graduates. Challenged by the gleeful graduate to account for
the inaccuracy of his forecast, the monk declares that his projections were
based on academic criteria alone, and points to a second frame of refer-
ence, one which is to dominate the story: "What I discussed was simply
literary merit. I have no intention of discussing fate with you."7> When
Wang fails yet again, Song explains to him the principles by which fate
operates: in determining the careers of men the divine administration lays
more stress on morality than on literary achievement. Wang’s failures so
far derive from neglect of moral cultivation, and his luck will turn if he
adheres to the way of virtue. Wang later receives further clarification: he
had been crossed off the register of officials-to-be because he bore responsi-
bility for the death of a concubine.

Here, and elsewhere in his tales,”© Pu Songling expresses the widespread
view that one’s examination experiences are predetermined by non-
academic factors, the moral credits or debits accumulated by oneself or
one’s ancestors. And so, though we may explain Pu’s failures in terms of
Statistical probability and a defective selection process, it is clear that Pu
himself would have offered a different answer, that which he supplies in a
passage from the preface to Liaozhai:

When the bow was hung at my father’s door, he dreamed that a
sickly-looking Buddhist priest, but half-covered by his stole, entered the
chamber. On one of his breasts was a round piece of plaster like a cash;
and my father, waking from sleep, found that I, just born, had a similar
black patch on my body. As a child, I was thin and constantly ailing,
and unable to hold my own in the battle of life. Our own home was
chill and desolate as a monastery; and working there for my livelihood
with my pen, I was as poor as a priest with his almsbowl. Often and
often I put my hand to my head and exclaimed, "Surely he who sat with
his face to the wall was myself in a previous existence"; and thus I
referred my non-success in this life to the influence of a destiny surviv-
ing from the last.77

Pu Songling and the Qing Examination System 107

Efforts have been made, most recently by Paul S. Ropp, to link Pu’s
reactions to the examinations with the critiques presented by seventeenth-
century thinkers like Huang Zongxi (1610-1695) and Gu Yanwu (1613-
1682), or the novelist Wu Jingzi (1701-1755).’8 As the foregoing discus-
sion has indicated, such comparisons must be hedged with qualifications.
Pu Songling’s orientation clearly differs enormously from that of intellec-
tual innovators such as Huang and Gu. Emerging from prosperous official
families, they do not appear to have felt a pressing need to prove them-
selves in the examination hall and establish their place in society on that
basis. Ming loyalists personally opposed to examination participation
after 1644, they did not hesitate to question basic assumptions and advo-
cate the reform of a system which they believed had contributed to the
decline of their dynasty.’9

By contrast, Pu Songling’s social position could.be improved only with
a higher degree, something he often reminded his sons as they in turn
toiled in the examination hall.89 As a member of a generation that
reached adulthood in the early Qing, he accepted the ground-rules by
which the existing system operated, and objected only to their violation or
neglect. His indignation over various abuses did not inspire any radical
rethinking, and this scattered protests against the irrational features of the
selection process do not amount to any fundamental expose. The gap
that divides Pu from a scholar such as Gu Yanwu is perhaps best illus-
trated by the following extract from Pu’s story "Yu Qu’e”:

Those officials who have attained their career ambitions do not cast so

78 Points of contact between Pu Songling’s ideas and those of early Qing thinkers have been
seen by such writers as Yang Liu, p. 66; and the Chinese Department of Beijing University,
in its "Pu Songling he tade Liaozhai zhiyi* (Pu Song)ing and his Liaozhai zhiyi), in Liaozhai
zhiyi xuan (Selection from Liaozhai zhiyi), ed. Zhang Youhe (Beijing: Renmin wenxue chu-
banshe, 1978), pp. 377-78. Paul S. Ropp includes Pu Songling in his survey of intellectual
critics of the examinations, Dissent in Early Modern China: ‘Ju-lin wai-shih’ and Ch’ing So-
cial Criticism (Ann Arbor, 1981), pp. 91-119.

much as a glance at the ancient classics, which were simply picked up
in their youth as a brick to knock upon the door and gain access to
fame and fortune, a brick to be cast aside as soon as the door has
opened; then, after ten or more years of handling official documents,
even an accomplished scholar will hardly have one literary phrase left in
his head. The reason why the shallow and inferior unexpectedly gain
advancement in the human world, whilst the heroic talents are
thwarted, is simply that this one examination (to weed out those unfit
to be examiners) is lacking.®!

Omitting the last sentence, Ropp has cited this passage as an instance of a
striking correspondence of views between the two men.®2 It is true that
Pu, like Gu, condemns the careerism which accompanies the examina-
tions, but the final lines make it clear that this is not his primary concern:
it is a problem only insofar as it has a bearing on the immediate preoccu-
pation of an examination candidate, the competence of his examiner.
Whereas Gu’s point of departure was the deterioration of intellectual stan-
dards and moral values, Pu’s protest was directed much more narrowly at
administrative weaknesses in the system.

In the limited scope of his criticisms, Pu Songling also contrasts with
Wu Jingzi. The latter was an altogether more unconventional and
bohemian individual who lost interest in examination participation in his
mid-thirties. His novel, written from a detached perspective, dwells at
length on the adverse impact of the examination system on the scholarly
world.83 Pu, as an examination candidate for most of his life, objected to
those features which presented obstacles to success on his own personal
level, and seldom explored the broader implications of the system’s
influence on society. It was no doubt difficult for him to distance himself
sufficiently from his own disappointments to adopt the analytical view
that Wu was able to take. Instead he endeavored in his tales to provide
answers to the immediate questions: why does a candidate fail, and how
can he pass? Only rarely could he stand apart from his own predicament
as he does in the story “Wang Zi’an," where after reviewing the sufferings
of an unsuccessful candidate in the provincial examination, he concludes,
"In such circumstances the competitors cry in torment, wishing they were
dead, but in the eyes of a spectator there is no sight more ludicrous."84

Pu Songling and the Qing Examination System 109

The difference between Pu Songling and Wu Jingzi was precisely that Pu
remained a "competitor" almost to the end of his days, whilst Wu soon
became simply a "spectator."

If Pu Songling can be distinguished from critics such as Gu Yanwu and
Wu Jingzi, then so too can the bulk of traditional intellectuals, and indeed
we can see Pu’s response to the examinations as more representative of
mainstream reaction than either Gu’s or Wu’s. In his exposure of various
abuses, he voices the dissatisfaction common among examination candi-
dates of his period. At the same time, in his emphasis on fate’s role in
determining the results, he articulates a widespread rationalization. His
stories are written from the point of view of an insider who, like many
men in the same position, responded to failure in a number of ways: now
cursing the examiners for their stupidity, now incensed by corruption and
other irregularities, now comforting himself by laying his humiliations at
the door of heavenly fate. It is as a creative literary expression of this
social undercurrent of deep-seated and ubiquitous frustration, rather than
as a critique of the examination system, that Pu Songlong’s tales are of
exception interest.
